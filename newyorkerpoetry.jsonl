To my shadow that’s been waiting for my return, homeless except when I was walking by its side in the summer light. To my shadow that wishes to go to school with the children of morning, but couldn’t fit through the classroom doors. To my shadow that has caught cold now, that’s been sneezing and coughing, no one there saying to it God bless! To my shadow that’s been crushed by cars and vans, its chest pierced by shrapnel and bullets flying with no wings, my shadow that no one’s attending to, bleeding black blood through its memory now, and forever"}

In all this time, I’ve seen maybe four or five. Droppings I’ve seen that prove they’re here— at the crossroads, at the turn. I picture one dished ear swivelling left then right as for a satellite while the buck sits and lifts his stone axe head, one of his sparring mitts tentatively folded toward his angular chest, alert, at rest. Partridges (or chukars) I often run across; they take off in a ruckus Greeks likened to flatulence— like rapidly deflating balloons. If ambulating, a matron and her brood bustle down the hill; ignoring the rude interloper, they will pretend to putter till spluttering aflutter. I’m not left agog by them—but for the hare almost as big as a dog— there’s no way to prepare for the huge unlikelihood. By the time I’ve understood something drastic has happened, it bounds into the bushy mastic pursued by ghost hounds. The light’s about to fail when it turns tail and the two black tips of its ears bob away. To see one’s to eclipse the rest of the day. Hares are not born blind.

Right now a leveret might be eyeing me, wound up with alarm to start forth from its grassy form and add to the slim count of hares I’ve seen on the mountain. The amount might double in thirteen more years—who can say. This one leaps away.Droppings I’ve seen that prove they’re here— at the crossroads, at the turn. I picture one dished ear swivelling left then right as for a satellite while the buck sits and lifts his stone axe head, one of his sparring mitts tentatively folded toward his angular chest, alert, at rest. Partridges (or chukars) I often run across; they take off in a ruckus Greeks likened to flatulence— like rapidly deflating balloons. If ambulating, a matron and her brood bustle down the hill; ignoring the rude interloper, they will pretend to putter till spluttering aflutter. I’m not left agog by them—but for the hare almost as big as a dog— there’s no way to prepare for the huge unlikelihood. By the time I’ve understood something drastic has happened, it bounds into the bushy mastic pursued by ghost hounds. The light’s about to fail when it turns tail and the two black tips of its ears bob away. To see one’s to eclipse the rest of the day. Hares are not born blind.

I want to capture it, a glimpse, sneak a peek at each distant future before the View-Master reel clicks. I want to follow the perfume of each life I could live and linger in it: the vanillas. Milk leaking from my breasts. Cereal. The piquant odor of parenthood. The one where I am a mother negotiating happiness. The one where I am not a mother and still negotiating happiness, beauty, and rest. Almost 39, and I’ve never loved myself more, yet nostalgia wavers all around me like a montage of mirages muddling memories, complicating hope, making me miss things I’ve already mourned. The bargaining—ain’t it a bitch? The bargaining aspect of grief, to constantly release that which I’ve already let go of, but how the water in my mind brings it all back like the flood current each day, and each morning, in the ebb I see the seafloor for what it is, another landscape of loss and renewal, another augur deciphering the tea leaves in the tide pool revealing the children I might never name, have, or hold. There is a finite number of eggs and books inside me. I am trying to release them. I am trying to mourn the possible futures bursting before me in a fantastic finale of fireworks, bursting in my mouth like red caviar as I try to find the right words to say goodbye to little faces I can only imagine.

Each decision seems to dissolve at the edge of the beach softened by the watercolor cream of winter floating above the same shore where Eliot wrote “The Waste Land” after a mental breakdown a hundred and one years before me, writing “On Margate Sands. / I can connect / Nothing with nothing.” I keep looking at the gentle waves for answers without trying to make another metaphor.

She worshipped culture, dissing her N.J. barbarian sister, my mother, too busy working in our dress store to groom me in the arts. Roz got tickets for Price’s “Aida” and the original “West Side Story.” She wangled box seats for us to hover above Arthur Rubinstein’s right shoulder. She got me Maria Tallchief’s autograph. “Artistic” but no artist, Roz lived la vie bohème , in her rent-controlled studio apartment a block from N.Y.U., as if it were a garret in Montparnasse. Bookkeeper with a high-school G.E.D., she fancied herself an intellectual. Exclamation points stabbed the margins of her Camus’s “Stranger” and Paul Valéry. Raped at thirteen was a story no one ever talked about. She grew up gorgeous, had a fling with fledgling tummler Danny Kaye in the Catskills hotel-resort her first husband owned. No one’s left to ask about husband No. 2. Saturdays, she fetched me from ballet at the Metropolitan Opera House. We lunched at Lindy’s, then bused to the bottom of Fifth Avenue. Holding hands, we skipped through the streets of Greenwich Village singing, and everybody smiled at me. At dusk, Roz unrolled the trundle bed. She baked fresh popovers for breakfast. She set up easels, oils, and canvases, a still-life of pears on her coffee table, and we painted all Sunday afternoon, alternating between the styles of Modigliani and Renoir. My love for her was unabashed. My parents tolerated our weekly tryst but disapproved of Roz’s extravagance while on the dole through family loans. Unemployed, she gained a hundred pounds and traded the mind for the body. Penguins morphed to Harlequins ferried by the bushel to and from the Strand. I visited her until I started college. Prowling Eighth Street for beatnik sandals and handwrought jewelry, I bypassed her address. I had aunt fatigue. She wore me out. She embarrassed me. I blamed my absences on an allergy to cats, her cats , who, one by one, succumbed before Aunt Roz died in a nursing home when I was forty. Her aqua Le Creusets, her beat-up ebony coffee table, her flacons of Cabochard all came to me. Custom-made dresses from Bendel’s. Her still fabulous costume jewelry. No one in the family wanted them. And, just today, I came across her hat hibernating in its Bonwit Teller box (itself a collectible, nosegays of violets floating on white ground) that’s been lost in my closet for some thirty years. Genuine red fox, “Zhivago” style, luxurious, silky, and perfectly preserved, the crown still stuffed with tissue paper, must have cost her three weeks’ pay. Purchased , the sweatband’s label reads, in the Oval Room at Ohrbach’s— on Thirty-fourth Street, the department store where you’d shop for bargains, far from Roz’s posh uptown salons. The hat doesn’t look half bad on me. But wearing fur in public is not P.C. Luckily, my nose begins to itch, my eyes water with unsentimental tears. Izzy, my gray tabby, sniffs the box.

Let’s call him the handsome stranger. She saw him through the little window next to the door and knew although she did not believe she believed in such things she had loved him in a former life. She gave him a glass of her legendary tea and let him go. My grandfather was upstairs in the immaculate attic where after they died I found this typewriter sleeping among old blueprints. During the war he diagrammed routes so trucks of soldiers could arrive precisely in time to wait for their orders. Or he worked in parts. I don’t remember. I can only picture that afternoon he told me exactly who he had been, I hear the resigned tone but not what he said, I was as is my nature staring out the kitchen window thinking some great hypothesis that could easily be disproved, that day now lost in the book no one can ever turn around and read.

Once she looked up from her eternal soup long enough to say to me you really must remove that terrible beard. What is the name of that sort of love? I want to look it up, I think it comes from the latin for not knowing the greek for the particular quiet of that afternoon I finally gave in and picked up the forbidden ceramic lion from the shelf, it slipped from my hands which already as they do today trembled and hit the very thick carpet with a silent thud, exploding into so many tiny pieces. Out of the kitchen she came with a broom and we both pretended it was never there. What is that sort of love? The dictionary knows. I opened it and found dust. I remember it had a solitary gold stripe across blue gray fabric like a dress you wear only once, by the sea. It must have arrived in the hands of a salesman whose name shall remain unrecorded. Let’s call him the handsome stranger. She saw him through the little window next to the door and knew although she did not believe she believed in such things she had loved him in a former life. She gave him a glass of her legendary tea and let him go. My grandfather was upstairs in the immaculate attic where after they died I found this typewriter sleeping among old blueprints. During the war he diagrammed routes so trucks of soldiers could arrive precisely in time to wait for their orders. Or he worked in parts. I don’t remember. I can only picture that afternoon he told me exactly who he had been, I hear the resigned tone but not what he said, I was as is my nature staring out the kitchen window thinking some great hypothesis that could easily be disproved, that day now lost in the book no one can ever turn around and read.

I could sense that it had a life underneath it. Because of this, I thought I was perhaps bad at seeing. Even color was not color, but a mood.

I had my hands out the window, weighing the air to see if it felt like a Saturday night or a Sunday, wondering if Dad would be let out of his cage in time to see god today.

They could never sit in our situations which is why they can’t get up &amp; break it down like we do &amp; this song made from Polynesian mystics, deceptive transformers, delivers us back to when we were down on ourselves doing ugly little things.

This is what made me worshipful &amp; marvellous, able to stand upright, &amp; some of that time I was dancing. This is what made me. A duplicate of Hineahuone, our blood of red sand. No matter how hard we sculpt ourselves, in the end we will always collapse back, &amp; in the meantime it is my friends who make me bow. Get on my hands &amp; knees for mop their drink up from the floor, kiss their beautiful ankles. My god, you are so talented, embodied &amp; creative.

Sugaring their lips with the fine grit of Sour Patch Kids, these strange children lift to their mouths those soft little bodies and chew.

It’s nearly time to reclaim their pool. Each day, each hour, they have dragged their soaking bodies from its coolness and allowed their mothers the reapplication of lotion and the petting of their wet, tender heads.

Lined on the plastic rim, the boys stare differently than the men they will become. The boy worries. Who promises tomorrows to a whole needful planet, restrikes that match? Who will remind this woman she’s not some queen acquiring a country estate—ruby brooches, oiled leaves of topiaries glistening in midday sun— while the real rural citizens starve.

A great mountain engulfed by a greater ocean, we formed, ever so slowly, from tectonic plates colliding, one mounting another, riding the way time rode sunlight and moonlight across the icy surface of the water. We learned, with time, to view and invent this life from the depths where beasts, now extinct, bellowed and belted their brutal songs.

We, in our faulted and faultless glamour, became a brand-new home for the bighorn sheep and lions, the canyon wrens and white-throated swifts swinging low below a cloudless sky. We drank the sky and threw up acres of wild prairie grass, piñon juniper, and ponderosa pine from the remains of ancestral ranges and sand dunes. Maybe this was love after all. We remained. We reinvented ourselves. We let the weaker parts of us go and decided, despite our egos and the tests of time, to test time and show how miraculous it is to exist. To live beyond survival. To be alive twice and thrice, and countless times to find one with and within another. What are the chances of that? One in a thousand. One in a million.

I had these the way Muir had his Sierras, a splendor alive in all my waking, a green mural of folded cliffs, plumeria blooms on patchy lawns, litter for the taking. Throughout childhood, I had my secret place, a splendor of mind amid urban squalor, palimpsests of imaginings to trace, while a car wreck screeched from the corner. I conjured yellow hau flowers, tofu shops, fishhooks baited with pink shrimp in waters tumbled from mossy stones, slate bells of clouds, the rippled silk of trade winds in blue tatters woven across a lagoon’s upturned face. A shut-in, latchkey kid, after school, I made games of cardboard, string. A sheet of foil was a silver pond where white egrets raced. I’ve since taken survey of other lands, parades of volcanoes, museum halls. I lived for pleasures that came to hand the way sea-run fish school by a waterfall. I learned of purple wines and their terroir. I gathered postcards at a stop-and-go. I hiked along a narrow road one summer, chasing the ghosts of Sora and Bashō. Another, my daughter ran on cobblestones down a winding, Kafkaesque street in Prague. Alarmed, just five, she’d found herself alone while I strolled ahead, my mind in a fog. It moved back, at work on a fantasy, something to do with Florentine lunettes, or a late spring snow at Kinkaku-ji, a lace chain of smoke from a cigarette. Imitations are what I’d sought, innocence I had as though a child’s—a saint’s chorus, unaging wonders taken from guidebooks that might beguile and blaze to magnificence. A copse of oaks, a lawn of fallen, umber leaves are refuge, my home is now my nation— walls of Chinese art, rugs of Turkish weave. I’m content with quieter intimations. What do I do these days of idleness? Fugitive thoughts pitch up, the mind’s coronas— an affair among redwoods in Inverness, a summer shower, ponds gold-lit in Laguna— from memory, phantoms and their auras. It’s as though I took a road up-mountain through fog for watercress near Waimea, Wham! on the radio, then steady rain, while I dreamt an image, an idea that gave a moment’s comfort when it came.

But it didn’t turn back for approval or get distracted by an insignificant thing, as a dog will tend to. No it was gone by now, it had made me nervous.

The egg- colored rug on which snow slowly melted from our boots. I remember the slowness of the hour in which we answered all the questions our marriage counsellor put to us. Imagine one of you has gotten sick. Imagine the schools you want your children educated in. And you and I, healthy but with no children, would spend the rest of an afternoon arguing about private schools and cancer treatments, until rage had pared your face to an acid set of lines and planes, so that at restaurants the waitresses would fill only your glass with water, and the female students at your law school, hearing of our troubles, delivered pies for you with notes expressing sympathy, which I devoured alone, tossing the notes they’d taped on the tins for you into the trash. I gained five pounds that winter, lost fifteen the spring you moved out. Perhaps, I remember telling the counsellor, there are worse crimes than falling out of love with one’s own husband or falling into some worse version of it with someone else, though at the time I couldn’t imagine what those were. Outside, in the counsellor’s parking lot, we would stand by the doors of our separate cars, sullen and flushed, as if each of us had contracted a specific fever that began at the same hour of the same day each week, in the same location, even, the radiator throwing off its blister of heat, the rag rug, the counsellor’s window slowly filling up with snow. Only after a week would the fever break, cooled into half-hearted jokes, or a stumbling embrace in our frozen yard: some new understanding of what we each could accept marriage to be— not the same relationship but something different, stranger, hard. I remember walking past the bathroom door one night and seeing you hunched there over the sink, the wide, white porcelain sides gripped in your palms, you panting like a deer that had been struck by a car. How much more pain were we willing to endure to prove we loved each other? Months before we’d married, I remember we talked about a child. It was Sunday, hot, we’d been walking past the shut doors of glass-fronted restaurants until we stopped at a corner filled with shocking pink streaks of bougainvillea. It’s the one thing, you told me, I really want. You were talking about a child. Heady vanilla scent, and bees. The sudden sense, as you touched your hand to the back of my neck, that I hated this embrace. Was it cruel I never told you no? Was it cruel you kept demanding it of me? The longer we argued, the harder it became to decipher what cruelty finally was: Was it cruel, for instance, if one of us chose to sleep on the couch, was it cruel if I fantasized about living in Europe, or you kept a portrait of a former wife on your bookshelf? On the last day of therapy together, you interrupted the counsellor to say that in order for you to remain in any way in my life, we would have to end the marriage now. Do you understand? you asked me. I touched my hand to the couch’s fraying comforter. There was, I understood, no unlimited care anyone should endure for another; that, in the end, it was indeed love that could make a reasonable person leave a marriage. When I’m asked to describe you to strangers now, I tell people the truth: you were kind, you were curious, we never hated each other, even on our worst night when I came into the kitchen to tell you what you already knew, I’d done something terrible, not naming it because you begged me not to. It was the one kindness I ever offered. I remember how you screamed and flung all the dishes in our cupboard to the floor, one by one until I stood inside a ring of white and blue and green porcelain that bloomed around me. Every dish we ever owned you threw, but even then, in our worst sorrow, making sure not one shard would touch me.

In the time that I have been gone, I never outgrew The sensation of being, nor for a moment forgot Which world was mine. I clung to the merest whispers, The faintest echoes that rose from below. For years, I lay on a down-filled sofa, alone with my passions. Bright refrains of endless azure circled The hours, and filled me with pleasure, but the poems I wrote were dulled by the sort of calm one feels In the downward drift of sleep. They never became The relics of light I wished them to be. In the days When it could be said I was one of you, I loved The beyond as somebody only can who is bound By the earth. All that I wrote was a hymn to desire, To the semblances and stages of bliss. My poems Bore only a passing likeness to the life Of which they were the miraculous part. But when I was borne among the erasures of heaven I began To believe that whatever was distant or puzzling could never Be made too obvious. Of course I was wrong. I’d allowed myself to be swayed by a vision of plainness That would have all things turn into one idea. So much for the past. May the worst of it fall by the wayside Tonight.

One of them is still on a slope of the Sandias, jeans pushed down to his knees so I can pick out the cactus needles from his thigh. The sky is late, the color of grape soda. In weeks, he will go to a war, write letters that now sleep in a box in the basement, next to a box of Christmas ornaments. I open a book I read in college and one of them is in the margins, his handwriting an enthusiastic vine, like the vines at the edges of medieval texts, each “O” of his cursive a tiny horse chestnut, the paperback’s pages yellow as a smoker’s fingers. Another one is still on his motorcycle between Connecticut and Manhattan, driving a cab on weekends for his tuition. On the nights I rode behind him, my head against the black leather of his back, I knew I would die many times before my death. One death for the one walking down Iowa Avenue, brooding on the problem of wearing a jacket over a Halloween costume. One death for the one scorned by his parents and brothers. One death for the one locked for days in his room, drawing lines in a notebook, over and over and over. Standing in front of a glass case in a museum, he is beside me, looking at the silver hand resting like a claw on the gray velvet. Another one is in his grandfather’s miles of orchards, a place more immense because he is a boy lost in it, even though everything he sees is his kingdom. There is no logic in what we keep. The freckles on his forearms. The surgery scar on his shoulder. The reliquary that outlasts the bone of the saint. In the coffeehouse, I see them, the lovers, the two teen-age boys on a couch, cuddling into one fused shape, one boy holding a phone they lean toward, their faces lit by the platinum glow. I have been them, and whatever comes after, and it has taken all my heart to contain both. There is no logic in what we keep, even of ourselves. I am near him on a winter beach, the sky above shining like coal. I am sitting with him on a sidewalk and he is weeping.

This venue’s at-home lasts all day; The first one here, David Suchet, De-Lyfts in front with Roman Hrybov, Snake Island hero: bearing beef plov, To supplement our entrées (plural). Meanwhile, near some mountains (Ural), A guy named Roizman—grim occasion— Gets detained for saying “invasion.” And, speaking of, we gotta shout: Brittney Griner was just let out! To her, and to her wife, Cherelle, We’re glad she’s back at home, and well. Out, out, out, out, out, out, out— Out of that country! Out, no doubt! The YouTube maven Yury Dud Has jetted here, and it’s so good To see him standing at our door. He’s in a crowd with Daniel Roher, Austin Tice, Eve Best, Bad Bunny, Patton Oswalt (super funny!), Dusty Baker, maestro royal, Rattan Lal, who studies soil, Machine Gun Kelly, Kaity Tong, And plus-ones who have come along. Thus we remark to Andy Yen, Zlatko Burić, Amartya Sen, Jamaal Bowman, Jamelle Bouie, Brandon Nimmo, Cousin Louis, Feryal Özel, and Roman Mars, Who’ve just arrived in different cars: “How ’bout that <em class=\"small\">NASA ? Did you hear The dazzling thing they did this year?” Then we speak about the rocket That smacked an asteroid to shock it, As if to get the rock’s attention, X million miles away! We mention— Coming back to Earth—our fandom, Choosing, in no way at random, Sadie Sink and Bong Joon-ho, Susan Cain, Willem Dafoe, Drake (the rapper), Emma D’Arcy, Professor Morgan (hello, Marcy!), Data wizard Newsha Ghaeli (One to be in touch with daily), And Aaron Judge, our long-ball champ, Who’ll still be ours come training camp. Hey! Look how we have been ignoring Hosting tasks as guests are pouring In and giving us their coats. We should be on it, taking notes: This one belongs to Colleen Hoover; These to Will Forte (he’s MacGruber), Ja Morant, Guillermo del Toro, Mark Levine, who leads our borough, Emilia Sykes, new congressperson (Proof that things don’t always worsen: Thirteenth District in Ohio, Won because she’s great, is why-o!). Where were we? Checking coats—that’s right. Now we ascend to greater height, To reach the topmost balcony, Whose views are steep and falcon-y, While strewing good will like confetti On the economist Raj Chetty, San Fran’s Mayor London Breed, Indie star Olivia Reid, Björk, Chris Smalls, Derrick Palmer, Khaby Lame (TikTok charmer), Yahya Abdul-Mateen the second (Actor of resources fecund), Bill Belichick, the wily coach, And gorgeous baby Hazel Roche! Indulge us, friends, as we remember Colleagues we lost since last December: Roger A., this ode’s Babe Ruth, Lee Lorenz, Peter S., George Booth, And let us here aver again it Rocked to work with wise John Bennet, Martin B., Sempé, and Brenda Phipps. As you’re hearing from our lips, Each was a brick; we hum their praises In these fond and clumsy phrases. Dear friends, we’re shelving ’22. It brought some good that shineth through: Freedom’s reboot, if just a sample, In Zelensky’s grand example; Democracy got off the mat (Turns out it wasn’t quite that flat); Add a mild return to reason, Reinforced by this, the season Rich in prompts to love our fellows. Leave the coda to the cellos— Measures deep and rich in tone Sing that we are none alone. Love kerns us all as words that rhyme, Reset once more this Christmastime"}

{"url": "https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/01/02/the-days", "poetry": "If only I could live my life, not write it, I’d have double the experience and be better at nothingness, at being present. The page, I once believed, offers permanence, sanctifying time, making it longer, but now I see my words as susceptible, even if digital, to fire, flood, misplacement. To misinterpretation. To accidental download by enemy. I don’t yet want them to be lost, but I dread the possibility that they won’t self-destruct at the end of my life, or the end of my lucidity. Maybe I’ve been using paper all wrong, committing to ink what should live in my head, which is part of my body, which will not last. Long ago, in college, a friend once said he would never keep a journal; he preferred to live in the moment. Back home in June, I threw the lot of them, dating back to childhood, into a rose-red shopping bag—we reused every one—then put the bag out with the trash. Thank the stars or our thrift for its luminosity: my mother asked what was in it, then ran down the driveway, hauled it back up. Her family had once lost everything. She knew what I wanted to be, what I already was. “You have to keep them!” she yelled. She never yelled. Even my friend, hearing it later, said the same. What worked for him might not be right for me. He loved to argue and was always there, vociferous, ready to engage, while I was too receptive, too easily swayed, though I often swatted back. That’s what college is for, the wisdom goes, late-night conversation with challenging peers. A few years later, we were no longer friends, not through conflict but cliché: he had wanted more, I had demurred, and then there was nothing to say. But maybe I’d been partial to aspects of his attention— maybe all the platitudes were true. I had failed to consider, despite constant reflection, what my being there must have conveyed. Reflection is simply an image, a face in a mirror; to look upon is not the same as to examine. Perhaps there is such a thing as a neutral observer. Each night, I had written Here is what happened like a kid whose pen makes her small life exciting, then gone on mistaking the plot for the story, as if the point of writing were writing. If only I could live my life, not write it, I’d have double the experience and be better at nothingness, at being present. The page, I once believed, offers permanence, sanctifying time, making it longer, but now I see my words as susceptible, even if digital, to fire, flood, misplacement. To misinterpretation. To accidental download by enemy. I don’t yet want them to be lost, but I dread the possibility that they won’t self-destruct at the end of my life, or the end of my lucidity. Maybe I’ve been using paper all wrong, committing to ink what should live in my head, which is part of my body, which will not last. Long ago, in college, a friend once said he would never keep a journal; he preferred to live in the moment. Back home in June, I threw the lot of them, dating back to childhood, into a rose-red shopping bag—we reused every one—then put the bag out with the trash. Thank the stars or our thrift for its luminosity: my mother asked what was in it, then ran down the driveway, hauled it back up. Her family had once lost everything. She knew what I wanted to be, what I already was. “You have to keep them!” she yelled. She never yelled. Even my friend, hearing it later, said the same. What worked for him might not be right for me. He loved to argue and was always there, vociferous, ready to engage, while I was too receptive, too easily swayed, though I often swatted back. That’s what college is for, the wisdom goes, late-night conversation with challenging peers.

But, whatever he was, he took Robert Johnson’s guitar, and he played the guitar, and played it well, and when Robert Johnson returned to the land of the living, the small towns, the juke joints, the bars, and the fields of elation and suffering, he was transformed in ways that let folks know that he left something behind with that big Black man. There is a faint line between gratitude and loathing, the self, turning in on itself—for what does it deserve? And it is not even a question in search of an answer, for the answer, elegant as a prayer, is as ancient as the pathologies of desperate people in search of a cult of hubris that says we cannot make of ourselves what we are not. It bears saying, for the sake of this art, that Robert Johnson is me, though my triumph was to leave the crossroads intact. No one offered me the genius of fingers— I waited, and the big Black man set the guitar down, walked away with his bowlegs and strut, tossing back, “Dat ting is out of tune.” So there is that. Back in the square, no one turned their faces from the glow of me, a few polite nods, and the dogs moved along with their doggy life, as the ancients like to say; and me, I returned to my hut, sat and watched the world pass me by, my heart thick with love in search of a home. Perhaps this is ambition, this persistent hunger. Today is a day of stomach cramps, the hollow melancholia of the interim, the slough between mountains, and this, too, is what it must be.

From my vantage in a second-story window of the split-level ranch where we kept our things, I could see some moths mistake the neon heat of a Blockbuster Video sign to the west for home, your babaji watering the impatiens in their beds beneath a local cosmos. Crisscross of the pinkening contrails, your bibiji nursing her twilight chai in a patio chair. She said a thing then that made them laugh, the clouds like painted bulls tumbling across a cave wall in this, the only known record of these events.

Death is a wish to improve one’s surroundings. Which is to say, to be dissatisfied with one’s surroundings is a form of death. To be dissatisfied with one’s child, to wish to improve one’s child, is to wish its death. Her death. The dead child is unchanging, therefore beautiful. Which is why we say that death is the father of beauty. He created her. Then he created her again. His tears gild his gaze. They harden as they hit the ground. They are a tribute scattered at her perfected feet. Unlike other forms of grief, they are durable, portable. A currency, they can be exchanged for other beautiful or useful things.

And at times, often, the unbearable. I bear it, though, just like you. Long ago, I bore a suitcase filled with books, bore it far on city streets. To sell, I guess, at some used-books place, one of those doorways down steps into dankness and darkness. The scent of mildewed, dog-eared, fingered pages. The suitcase, big and square and sharp-cornered, covered in snakeskin, bought at Goodwill for a dollar, knowing I had some travelling to do, some lugging, and I was right. What books I sold I do not know. Maybe that’s where “Modern Poetry” went. The cover cherry-red and blossom-white. I can see its spine in my mind’s eye, pointing downward beneath the dank and the dark to the water tunnelling under the city and making its way to the river. Poems sliding down the book’s spine into water, the shock of the cold and dank, down where my uterine lining, my blood and cast-off ovulations, cast-off fetal tissue swims, below the city. The micro-dead ride modern poems like swan boats in the park. From the park to the river to the sea. I’m thinking now of PJ Harvey and Nick Cave. Balladeers. Lovers. Vita and Virginia. Frank O’Hara and Vincent Warren. Somehow, we ride our lost loves out to sea. Or they ride us. It doesn’t matter. Poet or poem or reader, the same ectoplasm. The modern, in time, becomes antique, and the stone faces of the dead convert to symbols, ripe for smashing. Come to think of it, symbols are terrible. As the tyrant shouted to the masses, part of his brainwashing campaign: I know it, and you know it, too. I was twenty-three when I sold off “Modern Poetry” and sailed to Italy, seeking Romantic poetry, which was at one time modern, and found my way to Rome, and Keats’s death room. His deathbed, a facsimile. Everything he touched was burned, to kill what killed him. I lifted his death mask from its nail, cradled it, closed my eyes and kissed his lips until the plaster warmed, and stained his face with the lipstick on my lips. Red as the cover of “Modern Poetry.” The color of the droplets of arterial blood he coughed onto his sheets, and viewed by candlelight. Then he knew he was done for. His death warrant, he called it. After those many kisses over his face and eyes, and the reticulated eyelashes, cold and tangled, my lips were blossom-white, my face, chalked. Like I’d caught something from him, and I don’t just mean consumption, though my lungs burned for years. They still burn. This is the danger of the ecstasy of kissing the dead or dying poet on the mouth. The disease you’ll catch—well, it changes you. The tingle in the spine, the erotic charge, will be forever married to poetry’s previous incarnations. It’s why marriage itself never worked for me. I kept wanting to get to the part where death parts us and I could find myself again. Keats made such a compact corpse. Only five feet tall, shorter than Prince, and intricately made. Always, he was working it, working it out, the meaning of suffering, the world’s, his own, the encounter with beauty, nearly synonymous with suffering, how empathy could extinguish him, and he could set down the suitcase at last, or finally deliver him to himself, distinct as the waves in his hair and the bridge of his nose. How auspicious, rare, lush, bizarre, kinky, transcendent, romantic, to be young, just twenty-three, and to cradle him in my arms, as we listened to the burbling water of the Fontana della Barcaccia from the open window.

To shoo off a grouchy mouse. So they hear you from the last row of the theatre. So they hear you from the other side of the creek. So the fishes caught in the fish trap hear you. When you’re in water up to your neck, to call for a ring buoy. To measure the depth of a bottomless well. To invite the wolves to your birthday party. So everyone knows that yelling is not so easy. Because some others are unable to yell. So that the woods will learn your name. (Translated, from the Basque, by Elizabeth Macklin.) "}

We didn’t see it happen, but got there right after, before the ambulance and cops, before the snarl of cars that would have kept us from reaching you. I say us , but what I mean is my father, who told my brothers and me, Stay here , while my mother toggled between static and Tommy Dorsey and he ran to the jackknifed cab and found you pinned in there, left leg mostly severed but tethered enough under the crushed front dash to keep several bigger men from pulling you out. There was a lot of blood you were losing, and the tumbled lumber and concrete blocks from the load you’d been hauling, and the smashed glass of cling peaches in syrup from the truck you’d swerved into, and all around you fuel was pooling, collecting, threatening to catch fire, and I have to imagine what you would have heard: my father’s voice, calm and measured, saying, I’m a doctor . He might not have said a psychiatrist . What he showed you was his Swiss Army knife, what he did was ask permission to finish what the accident had started— to cut the tendon, cleanly, to free you. I guess we never know which part of ourselves we’ll have to sacrifice, or when we might need to say to a stranger with a pocketknife, I’d be obliged . And that was that. They pulled you out. Someone may have grabbed the mangled leg as an after- thought, but this was 1966, before the age of reattachments. My father knelt in the snow and wiped his knife blade clean. This was before there would be people on the road we could not help, before the next Christmas, and the ones after that, when a crate of oranges would come from Baltimore, with a card that said Best wishes from the leg and me , never specifying which leg you meant—the one you kept or the one you let go.

I still have my mother humming “I Thought About You,” still have my brothers punching each other in the wayback, still have my father, still running with his Swiss Army, as if he could, in some coming blizzard, save us all.

It’s upsetting, the whole charade, except at lunch when she orders fries and no one says, We’re so bad , or at the meeting when she gives the room all her best ideas and they say, Man , where have you been ? We have to fix this , her husband begs when the wife returns for dinner. Come here , she says, slipping off her shoes and drawing the curtains before she makes love to another life.

If you lifted a round metal covering And dropped a stone, you could Hear it plonk into the depths. There were small hollows in the rocks That, no matter how dry the weather, Were filled with rainwater. These rock pools must have been here With different water in them That summer when the rebels Fled toward Needham’s Gap. From the hill, as the croppies did, You can view the town, narrow Streets even narrower, and more Trees and gardens than you imagined. It was burning then, of course, But now it is quiet. There is, In the Market Square, a monument To Father Murphy and the Croppy Boy. We can see the hill from our house. It is solid rock in the mornings As the sun appears from just behind it. It changes as the day does. My mother is taking art classes And, thinking it natural to make The hill her focal point, Is trying to paint it. What color is Vinegar Hill? How does it rise above the town? It is humped as much as round. There is no point in invoking History. The hill is above all that, Intractable, unknowable, serene.

The rock also Glints in the afternoon light, Which dwindles, making the glint disappear. Then there is the small matter of clouds, Which make tracks over the hill in a smoke Of white, as though instructed By their superiors to break camp.

Until this time, they are surrounded by sky And can, as yet, envisage no way out. The town reservoir on the hill Was built in the twenties. If you lifted a round metal covering And dropped a stone, you could Hear it plonk into the depths. There were small hollows in the rocks That, no matter how dry the weather, Were filled with rainwater. These rock pools must have been here With different water in them That summer when the rebels Fled toward Needham’s Gap. From the hill, as the croppies did, You can view the town, narrow Streets even narrower, and more Trees and gardens than you imagined. It was burning then, of course, But now it is quiet. There is, In the Market Square, a monument To Father Murphy and the Croppy Boy. We can see the hill from our house. It is solid rock in the mornings As the sun appears from just behind it. It changes as the day does. My mother is taking art classes And, thinking it natural to make The hill her focal point, Is trying to paint it. What color is Vinegar Hill? How does it rise above the town? It is humped as much as round. There is no point in invoking History. The hill is above all that, Intractable, unknowable, serene. It is in shade, then in light, And often caught between. When the blue becomes gray And fades more, the green glistens, And then not so much.

He painted off a ladder this summer. Asks if I’ve smelled the difference between fear and regular sweat. Down the road, there’s a church with a tall wooden door where we once kissed so fast the earrings fell off my head. Today he lives with a beautiful artist. I often think of him holding my thighs beside a river after we finished a bottle of Malbec. Mosquitos pulling little blankets above the grass. I know if I sit here long enough he will say the thing he forgets he always says: You’re a planet. I never want you to leave. I know I am not the only woman he keeps wrapped in the same story. Because I’ve been hurt, I order another drink. Wait for him to say what men say before getting married: Loving you is its own time. A place that always exists but cannot in this life."}

The Dickens could stay. You understand. And the air is important to note for what it is doing to the pink lungs, bronchioles— a life of inflammation. Wave, girls , the teacher says to the shivering and ironed line of them. And wave she did. And if he cared to see into the minds of teen-aged girls, this King would’ve seen then When I was a small child, I think, about five or six, I must’ve heard something, some cassette turning to dust in the car’s player, notes stretched, song that quieted, in the front seat, my parents, some tape spooled back with a ballpoint pen and worn to mica in the car’s player as the turn signal clicked its quiet, and the keys clicked with the wide and final turn— song which was, I’m sure, an ancient poem sung and filled with cypresses, their upright windscreen for what must be grown. Downwind, I walked the wide hallways of a great endowment. It didn’t matter if I did or didn’t. It changed only myself, the doing. It fed down to one knuckle then the next, this compromise. It fed down to one frequency and another, leaving me only a scrambled sound. It would burn your fingertips to walk the length of the hall dragging them along the grass-papered walls where they punished you for not wanting enough. For not wanting to be nonbelligerent by naming the terms for belligerence. The shellacked shelves, the softly shaking pens in their pen case. What was given there could be taken, and quietly, you were reminded of this. You were reminded all was property of the West. The mess of a raven’s nest built behind a donor’s great bust then gone. The mess of bird shit on the steps then gone. All dismantled and scrubbed sensibility. And this was it. This nowhere. What awaits us on the other side of alphabet, scrawl serrated, all slit, all hole, red with scream, I do not know. Someone posts a picture of the Poet’s tomb and I want to say, That’s my city — but I am left with the lie of my . I said what I said and stayed saying long after the people left. A poet as a fixed position most cannot stand to be in for long. Someone snaps a photo and moves on. Someone provides a corpse for this great wall. Maybe I shouldn’t have taken you there , she said of our trip to her childhood home. For years, I wrote of the bumps left by the tanks churning over her roads as braille messages from the martyrs , which meant I missed it entirely, the only it: my mother’s face turned out the passenger window, Summer. Harvest done. The last stone fruit pitted, jarred, spoiling the last white shirt— Row of cypress, sun-blistered fences. Solid and settled masonry. The unseen town and town just beyond. The echo as if inside a room of stone. I felt each world was one cypress-lined path and each path had one of us, bagless and awake, walking wind and footfalls. I felt we were heading to meet somewhere. I tried to say it was dead, the song, but then it came, my mother singing of cypress— I tried to leave the literal, but it got lonely— I tried to leave desire, but it scratched at the door, tapped its empty bowl against the floor— I tried not to answer, but the bulb shone— I saw that the head bent over a book I couldn’t see beneath a single yellow lamp of a childhood not mine was my mother’s mind alight It seemed the astrologer might back away from the stench— There are too many and it is hard to tell what is for you in the noise. I didn’t ask if the prisoner with the sharpened spoon handle to the wrist came, saying, Tell my mother — or the mother salting a meal she won’t taste herself. At a gate, it seemed the officers knew I was coming. Their questions tailored. At a gate, I was asked the name of my father, my father’s father, beneath a shivering bulb, and whether I write plays. At a gate, one man selling gladiolas wrapped in plastic out of a black bucket. One selling wreaths. One selling water. At a gate, the men gathered to discuss building a playground over the unmarked graves. At a gate, I watched one hand outstretched, saying, Come. I thought it was loss— language, its little radius— when it’s a beckoning, a way. Enough , I said. I plotted. In the mornings, I wrote. In my sleep, I wrote with fancier, more elaborate inks. And in my writing I began to write of cypresses. And of small and sharp stone. And I, on this path, a wooden handle in my palm, and a blade at the end of it. And beyond, their windscreen, the unseen.

Readers encountering a mother in Iran ordered to remove books from a school library—“Russians, mostly”—may be reminded of the various writers and laureates recently, and regularly, deemed unfit for American schools. “The Dickens could stay. / You understand.” This violence threatens both books and bodies, with beauty still managing to survive. Yet rich imagery, for Sharif, is more indictment than absolution; she describes “A poet as a fixed position // most cannot stand to be in / for long.” “An Otherwise” evokes the epic, which Ezra Pound defined as “a poem containing history”—or is that, too, just another name for war? Here are gates and journeys, cypresses and oiled rifles, a poet returning to what once was or might have been home and claiming the betrayals even of language. What can poetry provide where so much is lost—or erased—in telling and translation? “I tried to leave the literal, / but it got lonely—,” Sharif writes. She urges us toward a new set of customs, beyond the policed borders of nations, memory, imagination—that shifting space, where a mother waits, waving hello or so long or beckoning us onward. —<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/kevin-young\">Kevin Young</a> <p class=\"has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading paywall\">Downwind from a British Petroleum refinery, my mother is removing the books she was ordered to remove from the school library. Russians, mostly. Gorky’s “Mother” among them. The Shah is coming to tour the school. It is winter. In the cold, the schoolgirls line up along the front of the main building and wait for his motorcade. Knee-highs and pleated skirts. Shivering in the refined air. Wave, girls , the teacher says. My mother, waving. Put another way: The must of the glued spines and silverfish, metal shelves, my mother reaching on tiptoe to take down Gorky, for example, filling her arms with stacks of books. The Dickens could stay. You understand. And the air is important to note for what it is doing to the pink lungs, bronchioles— a life of inflammation. Wave, girls , the teacher says to the shivering and ironed line of them. And wave she did. And if he cared to see into the minds of teen-aged girls, this King would’ve seen then the rifles pointed at him. When I was a small child, I think, about five or six, I must’ve heard something, some cassette turning to dust in the car’s player, notes stretched, song that quieted, in the front seat, my parents, some tape spooled back with a ballpoint pen and worn to mica in the car’s player as the turn signal clicked its quiet, and the keys clicked with the wide and final turn— song which was, I’m sure, an ancient poem sung and filled with cypresses, their upright windscreen for what must be grown. Downwind, I walked the wide hallways of a great endowment. It didn’t matter if I did or didn’t. It changed only myself, the doing. It fed down to one knuckle then the next, this compromise. It fed down to one frequency and another, leaving me only a scrambled sound. It would burn your fingertips to walk the length of the hall dragging them along the grass-papered walls where they punished you for not wanting enough. For not wanting to be nonbelligerent by naming the terms for belligerence. The shellacked shelves, the softly shaking pens in their pen case. What was given there could be taken, and quietly, you were reminded of this. You were reminded all was property of the West. The mess of a raven’s nest built behind a donor’s great bust then gone. The mess of bird shit on the steps then gone. All dismantled and scrubbed sensibility. And this was it. This nowhere. My school of resentment commenced. What awaits us on the other side of alphabet, scrawl serrated, all slit, all hole, red with scream, I do not know. The knowing is the dullest part of all. Someone posts a picture of the Poet’s tomb and I want to say, That’s my city — but I am left with the lie of my . I said what I said and stayed saying what I came to say long after the people left. A poet as a fixed position most cannot stand to be in for long. Someone snaps a photo and moves on. Someone provides a corpse for this great wall. Maybe I shouldn’t have taken you there , she said of our trip to her childhood home. For years, I wrote of the bumps left by the tanks churning over her roads as braille messages from the martyrs , which meant I missed it entirely, the only it: my mother’s face turned out the passenger window, just looking. Summer. Harvest done. The last stone fruit pitted, jarred, spoiling the last white shirt— Row of cypress, sun-blistered fences. Solid and settled masonry. The unseen town and town just beyond. The echo as if inside a room of stone. I felt each world was one cypress-lined path and each path had one of us, bagless and awake, walking wind and footfalls. I felt we were heading to meet somewhere. I tried to say it was dead, the song, but then it came, my mother singing of cypress— I tried to leave the literal, but it got lonely— I tried to leave desire, but it scratched at the door, tapped its empty bowl against the floor— I tried not to answer, but the bulb shone— I saw that the head bent over a book I couldn’t see beneath a single yellow lamp through the evening window of a childhood not mine was my mother’s mind alight learning to oil a rifle. It seemed the astrologer might back away from the stench— There are too many and it is hard to tell what is for you in the noise. I didn’t ask if the prisoner with the sharpened spoon handle to the wrist came, saying, Tell my mother — or the mother salting a meal she won’t taste herself. At a gate, it seemed the officers knew I was coming. Their questions tailored. At a gate, I was asked the name of my father, my father’s father, beneath a shivering bulb, and whether I write plays. At a gate, one man selling gladiolas wrapped in plastic out of a black bucket. One selling wreaths. One selling water. At a gate, the men gathered to discuss building a playground over the unmarked graves. At a gate, I watched one hand outstretched, saying, Come. I thought it was loss— language, its little radius— when it’s a beckoning, a way. At one gate, my mother waving. Enough , I said. I plotted. In the mornings, I wrote. In my sleep, I wrote with fancier, more elaborate inks. And in my writing I began to write of cypresses. And of small and sharp stone. And I, on this path, a wooden handle in my palm, and a blade at the end of it. And beyond, their windscreen, the unseen. I knew not the poem, only the weather. I knew not the listening, only this landscape, its one clear channel. The metal in my teeth caught its frequency. The iron shavings of my blood pulled toward this otherwise.

These worlds—these trembling globes Of shivering grapes—they threaten us, And constellations of golden oils, Their canopies elastic, expanding, Hang suspended like stolen cities, Dangle like broken promises, Golden slanders, slips of the tongue, And berries of poisonous cold. The decimal light of speeds ground to a ray Begins the count as it moves through ether, Transparentized by countless zeros, Their hungry moths and radiating pain. And from beyond the field of fields, a new field In flight, like a crane’s triangular wedge, In a fresh coat of dustlight, the news hurtles in, With yesterday’s battle still lighting the way. In a fresh coat of dustlight, the news hurtles in: “I’m neither a Leipzig, nor a Waterloo, Nor a Battle of Nations, I’m new, And I’m coming to light up the light.” A mash, a hash, this Arabian muddle, The light of speeds ground down to a ray, And with the crooked soles of its feet The ray stands tall on my retina.

From life itself the skull evolves, Temple to temple, to the forehead’s top. It teases itself with its perfect seams, Brightens to clarity as a knowing dome, In dreams of itself, foaming with thought— Fatherland for fatherland, this cup of cups, A skullcap sewn with starry fringe, This cap of good fortune—Shakespeare’s sire. Clarity of ash, keen vision of the sycamore— It rushes homeward, just a bit reddish, As if it would with swooning stockpile Both skies, their dim fires glowing. Only excess unites us in union.

All night the sofa gossips with the Turkish carpet, which boasts to the glass-fronted bookcase about the fantastic voyages of its youth. These things remember so that we can forget. Who will love the old if not the old?"}

You’re here! We’ve made it through another year Together, somehow, bless us all. Now let’s adjourn to our Great Hall, Whose walls, we’re told, are well bedecked, ’n’ Punch bowls checked for ivermectin. The stars arrive, both nat. and local: Both Bidens, natch, and our Gov. Hochul. Jill, Joe, and Kathy, sit ye down Around the blazing Christmas noun Beside Saul Griffith, whom we’re tight with (Someone Joe should talk all night with), And lean in close to Rachel Cusk, Barbara Kingsolver, Elon Musk, Harry Styles, Lisa Yuskavage, Jorge Ramos, Adam Savage, Olympic champ Sunisa Lee, And Dr. Annie Onishi. We wish pure bliss to Allie Brosh As she enjoys a Yuletide nosh, And happiness without surcease To all the U.S. Capitol Police, Who’ve honored us by stopping by. There’s Omar Sy—Yo, Omar, hi! He must meet Lucas Hnath, the playwright, It sounds like “nayth”—that’s how you say right— Plus, film director Hwang Dong-hyuk Might cast him on the spot. What luck! Now, let us be completely clear: We’re nuts for Tara VanDerveer, The Stanford women’s b-ball coach; That’s ditto for Ukweli Roach, Vaccine wizard Lexi Walls, Our buds from Cuyahoga Falls, Sam Swope, Lil Yachty, Sarah Snook, Daniel Kaluuya, King Mel Brooks, U.C.L.A.’s Johnny Juzang, Bony Ramirez, Bowen Yang . . . The vibes are changing. Something mutters, Flutters in the flung-back shutters; Then Christmas spirits, à la Dickens, Fill the air as gladness quickens Everyone within their range! Bo Burnham doesn’t find this strange. Meanwhile, Adar Poonawalla (Philanthrope and pharma-wallah), Blitz Bazawule, David Spade. Kind Mrs. Wise, from seventh grade, Mr. Gurnah, lit. Nobel-er, Zaila Avant-garde, top speller, Mary Beard, Aisling Chin-Yee, Researcher Adi Utarini, Fintan O’Toole, and Lil Nas X Feel joy way past what one expects. Our rafter-mounted jumbotron Displays the mixing going on: Xander Bogaerts, ace infielder, Jaap van Zweden, baton-wielder, Mike Lupica, his mom and dad (A clan that makes us really glad), Jason Sudeikis, and Tom Scott Are chatting in a festive spot, Adjacent to the Santa chair Hard by the boar’s head (medium rare), As on a couple hundred plates Fruitcake flambé illuminates Confabs involving Sasha Lane, New York’s A.G. Letitia James, Edward Enninful, style maven, Senior golfer Corey Pavin, Eric Adams, our next mayor, Bishop Dietsche, a major prayer, Sturgeon macher Gary Greengrass, Wrestling co-capt. Michael Elsass, Flula Borg, the cool comedian, And lawyer Mitchell Garabedian, Who all erupt in welcoming song For June King Erskine and Isla Shawn, Excellent and wondrous babies, Sans disclaimers, ifs, or maybes! Dear friends, this year was not as bad As ’twenty was, or quite as sad, Admittedly a fine distinction On our glide path to extinction. Hey, bite your tongue! Walk that thought back. Unseemly gloom is really wack. Light shines, the darkness did not end it; Nor could the darkness comprehend it. A future’s ours to win or lose it, Hope still awaits us if we choose it. May the dread Omicron spare us (One more thing to wrack and scare us); May every forest soon be rid Of the woolly adelgid, And peace and blessings light the way For all of us this Christmas Day! ♦Blitz Bazawule, David Spade.

All morning, as if it didn’t touch me, as indeed it doesn’t, mostly, one daughter dead, another mad as jacks, drafts and diaries scattered like a plane crash in the ocean. And fragments as fruition, and exile like a birthright, and, as the sun bleeds out one evening like a suicide, suicide. All morning my exercise to keep these muscles strong enough to recognize the weakness meaning time, to climb out as if there were an out, to dry off as if there were a dry, to look back at a body of water, which, like all water, leaves no trace."}

We fool no one and are no one’s fool, least of all the late summer gods who know a burn, who rope in hope, who prepare us for a meal of dead light. In August, I want snow. I want July. Midsummer prophet sight. Belief. Faith. A cathedral with all her weight. A winter love. A new year. A regal infancy. A Sunday, born."}

To travel back in time is to rememberWhen Amanda Gorman <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/amanda-gormans-inaugural-poem-is-a-stunning-vision-of-democracy\">read her poem</a> “The Hill We Climb” at the 2021 U.S. Presidential Inauguration, she became both the inheritor of a long tradition and a herald of something new. Her verse, as vibrant and elegant as her yellow coat against the cold, illuminated the imagination as well as the occasion, confirming her as a worthy successor to several other Black women inaugural poets writing to and for an American ideal—a lineage traceable all the way back to <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/how-phillis-wheatley-was-recovered-through-history\">Phillis Wheatley</a>, who, at the dawn of the Republic, addressed a poem to then General George Washington. As Gorman acknowledged this country’s contested history, and its contemporary tumult, her invocation of the plural pronoun “we” reminded us that, for good or literal ill, our lives are connected. Hers was an invitation to move forward together. Gorman continues to explore the “we” further in her new collection, “<a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.amazon.com/Hill-We-Climb-Other-Poems/dp/0593465067\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/Hill-We-Climb-Other-Poems/dp/0593465067\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Hill-We-Climb-Other-Poems/dp/0593465067\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Call Us What We Carry</a>,” which she calls an “occasional book”—one framed by our many mutating yet seemingly immutable pandemics, from <em class=\"small\">COVID -19 and racism to climate catastrophes and a general malaise. In “penning a letter to the world as a daughter of it,” Gorman doesn’t merely transcribe a diary of a plague year; her bold, oracular pronouncements bear witness to collective experience, with an uncanny confidence and a prescient tone that are all the poet’s own. By turns devotional and pushing the limits of the page, many poems in the book play with form—appearing as questionnaires and text-message conversations, or taking on the shapes of an urn, a whale, a flag—in ways reminiscent of George Herbert or the concrete poets of the nineteen-sixties, another tempestuous time in search of fixity. Gorman insists that “We are not me— / We are we,” and her poetry is unafraid to name all that we carry. “Our scars,” she writes, “are the brightest / Parts of us.” —Kevin Young Allegedly the worst is behind us.

It was how they knew they were on a journey to save themselves from the sudden loss of a season. At the intersection of three busy roads, two buses broke down and spilled us out, humans tired of the road. We watched the beauty of the Presidential palace. I wondered how many days of sweat went into the earth to produce such beauty. While smoking, I met a man called Trolley, named for his expertise in flinging humans across borders. His works of terror were suffering in the coldness of brothels across Bamako, across Tripoli, across Mauritania, and on the red sand of Kayes. He watched his girls drink gin on the sidewalk. I asked him, Do you feel shame? He answered, I desire beauty. In its pursuit there is no end, only ruthlessness. The road sang a dirge, the girls danced in sadness. There, on the road that is no home, I looked into his eyes and saw the terror of exploitation. A leaf fell from a tree nearby and again I was reminded of the endless movement of the world, of the girls dancing, of the sadness of my fingers obeying the call of my body’s addiction to nicotine, as a bird sang of leaving the world as it is, a terror, a war we are still living in. A sign on the road read: Buy handmade drums and beat the wildness of your soul. What is the sound of all our sorrow? Years after a war, a veteran went crazy from hearing in his head the wailing of a thousand women who gave up peace to sing their dead sons to the afterlife. Is this not a kind of wildness? Music breeds its own fear, a song leads us to our loneliness as the spools of a cassette turning in a radio render us into an animal dying in an empty lair. What is the ache of the night? What is the emptiness of a city full of voices? The voice of exile is the dying voice of a wounded angel. I beat the drum of my life and the angel and I dance to its wild sadness, even God ran away from this rhythm. Look around you, we are left alone with the mud of creation and maybe that is all there is to life, the creating of a new way of living, but God! Where do we hide the violence? The driver says, in the dark of the night, when every passenger is asleep, he hears the true language of the road. He says he hears the voices of cities thousands of miles away. The voice of exile is a murmur crossing rivers and sea, crossing empty roads until it washes over a man, a baptism of loss. If the road and the driver could speak to each other, what will be this language born out of friction? Would it be the hum of sleep in the bodies of exhausted travellers? Would it be the bristling of biscuit wrappers? The driver’s eyes are full of dreams, full of the excitement of new cities. He could be the poorer incarnate of Mansa Musa who instead of pouring gold dust into air pours stories to compete with sand, stories of nomads, people running in and out of cities. Perfect gold, this human scroll of chronicles. Even Bessie Head, giant of letters, who battled sands for stories, would be proud of this precision of narrative, this perfect bridge of the imagined and the songs of mothers rocking babies as countries cut through their bodies. Our bus parked beside a water fountain, a cherub spilled water from pouted lips. Across the hotel park, there were oysters heaped on enamel trays, fried behind walls, they were offered to us as secrets of the sea. Behind this market of oysters, there was once a market for flesh, in Ouidah, in rooms filled with Black flesh in chains, branded like cattle, herded into pens by other Black men paid in clear bottles of gin. The sea crashed on naked stones and we ran into the hotel bar. Perched on a three-legged stool, an old Black woman sang the fable of siblings lost at sea, she was a lamp attracting us as moths. There were opened windows, sunflowers in broken pots, curtains made out of beads sang in the wind, birds flew in and out. Smoking a carefully rolled blunt, I listened to this place, a silent television played a Nollywood movie. We were trapped in time, in the commodification of flesh, saints without the gift of ablution. In some other world, I am guilty of silence, just as I am in this one. Do not forgive me.

Rising Out of the drowned kingdom, Some walked in the direction of Mali Toward the blue chant coming from the cow Skin and string stretched over the calabash’s mouth, A kora carrying Timbuktu’s salt market— Its holler and gold—over the executioners, The sharks’ desolate dorsal fins cutting The horizon, the ocean into before And after I could no longer touch My mother’s name, the night her fingers Make when they touch my eyelids Which is the origin of night— A woman’s hand to your face, a fire after, Walking beneath it until a bird lifts dawn Over an orchid’s screaming white head and the stone- Colored cat crouching in the grass waiting To pounce on dawn’s light emissary Drowning, drowning in dawn. Some of the drowned walked through The emptying waves toward the indigo Bushes burning on an unknown shore, Their names called on brick plantations, In rows of cotton, the thorn of which Mixed them down to blood and land And someone calling out to them for rest, A night, a forest, a snake to ride Out of the marsh buckling down into heat, Leech, and the crooked day laboring Their laboring bodies, its fingers jammed Into their mouths, prying their lips apart As if to see into that little bit of privacy, The darkness, covering their runagate Runagate hearts. The memory of wood, Tunisia burned; this call put into the dead For rest, a forest, a snake to ride. Do you not hear our names being called, Said a man who carried the splinters Of wood from the ship’s belly beneath his nails. Do you not hear your name?"}

His trenchcoat had been made by Thomas Burberry. The last time I’d seen him he’d presented me with a pot of jam for my journey and a rumpled copy of “The Big Sleep.” 2 I’d set out that morning fortified by the aroma of Nescafé that must have wafted over from as far away as Brannigan’s. I knew flax-holes were bog-holes with linnets. I knew Uncle Pat’s Ford Prefect was a donkey cart with a motor. 3 I also knew that, in June, 1954, the I.R.A. had raided Gough Barracks in Armagh and made off with a lorry-load of Sten and Bren guns. The myxoma virus was introduced to Ireland that same summer. When we’d moved from Eglish to Collegelands these damson trees were already mature. Even though we’d now lived here for five years we were still newcomers. 4 It would take more than a clip round the ear to assuage my lifelong fear of stretches of bog road like the one outside Urney where we’d been stopped by soldiers in what I took for Jeeps. In a novel by Raymond Chandler a man may never lower his defenses as he climbs toward the chandelier to the accompaniment of tambourine and tabor. When would I be done with the tuppenny world, the turbary? It would take more than a clip round the ear to bring me to my senses. 5 By the time I’d heard of “A Coney Island of the Mind” I knew it wasn’t the Coney Island to which Pat had driven us a mere ten miles. My mother had told me flax was pulverized by boys who insisted on being boys. 6 As I’d set out I had a cheer of encouragement from another neighbor on his way to work in the Moygashel linen mills. Although I’d seen many of their kind die of myxomatosis I’d acquired two fresh rabbits in Belfast. I was equipped with a parachute, needless to say, and my recurve bow. The technical term for my mother’s drooping eyelids was ptosis. 7 As I tried to get clear of the world of seed-surges and menses so many held so dear I carried that pot of jam and a sense of life being worthless. I was still trying to fathom why I should be attending the ritual cleansing at the altar of a woman who had recently given birth. 8 I can’t say I expected to move in the same orbit as Yuri Gagarin, now I’d managed to kick away the ladder, but I would have been glad to share the cloudberries left in the punnet I’d gathered from a north-facing slope in Mullaguttural. 9 One of the big dangers in keeping rabbits is that the doe is more likely than not to eat her litter. We kept them in separate hutches under the row of damsons. From this vantage point I could see Armagh and the twin spires of St. Patrick’s Cathedral. The story went the I.R.A. man who led the raid was carrying a Thompson. 10 I was still trying to get clear why Macha’s charioteer had dandled a Barbary ape imported from Gibraltar when he should have been tightening the pony’s girth. In a novel by Raymond Chandler a man may charge twenty-five dollars a day plus expenses as he climbs toward the chandelier. Here I would still wear an altar boy’s soutane and surplice and hover like his own phantasm as he tried to get clear of the world of seed-surges and menses. 11 The constant friction in Northern Ireland made the term “Orange Free State” seem nuts yet Larry Toal had an Orange Free State stamp complete with its original gum. There was little likelihood Catholics would ever achieve parity. 12 I may have started climbing because I’d been slapped for some minor infraction. Not the little slap Bacall gives Bogart in “To Have and Have Not.” More like the slap Gunnar gives Hallgerdur in Njál’s Saga. Hard to believe that in years to come I would drive Lauren Bacall home from a New York party. Larry Toal had heard the National Museum of Ireland owned a stuffed quagga. 13 What the parishioners held dear was the idea there would be no consequences for giving someone a clip round the ear. When would I ever be done with the effrontery of a clip round the ear or a slap in the dial from the parish priest for having suggested that a three-leaf clover represented the Trinity as one flesh? 14 As time went by, my mother would take to singing “The Lonely Goatherd.” The chances of finding a springbok in the National Museum were about as strong as finding a beatnik on a bog road between Balleybofey and Lifford. 15 The small crowd that had by now gathered was almost equally divided between spurring me on and ordering me back. I loved how Hallgerdur would later deny Gunnar a strand of her hair to replace his broken bowstring. My parachute straps had been made at Moygashel as part of the war effort. The damsons were themselves notorious for sending out runners. 16 What the crowd holds dear is the notion there’ll be no reckoning in the political sphere. In August, 1971, my neighbor would be bundled into an Army Land Rover and installed in a new prison in Long Kesh. Surely it’s not only in a novel by Raymond Chandler that a body tenses? Even as I climbed toward the amber chandelier the Unionists, almost as an involuntary response, had introduced internment without trial.

We are uncovered &amp; mustering strength. Never mind my mother’s post-stroke slurred speech &amp; vertigo, her ear crystals misaligned, her neck brace. We are survivors of the panic wars. We are reaching new conclusions intuitively from inferences about hugging. My radar is broken. I’m not sure where to put all my limbs. When they’re tangled with yours it’s not a problem. Your failing configurations of attention. My bad knees. To draw fabric into puckers: pleated pants, rumpled sheets, your fingers hooked in my underpants &amp; we bring together all the parts of ourselves to embrace— haul in our bodies. To harvest, like clusters of ripened cherry tomatoes still warm from the sun. Forget the kale, stripped bare by bright- green cabbage worms congregating on thick stems. To summon everyone back to this abundant &amp; skeletal planet after we’ve jettisoned the billionaires into space. We celebrate the launch with tiny coupes of champagne. To throw open the doors &amp; host guests &amp; board packed planes where everyone is cranked &amp; cranky about proximity still. But look at the skyline— clutches of buildings reaching for billows of clouds. To assemble in a sequence for binding, somewhere past contact tracing. Gather is a transitive verb."}

But from the same source I learned that truth disappears in the telling of it, and this, spurious as it seemed, since it unwrites what it teaches, cast doubt on everything else—the same way a mad raving might come in the same door of the mind as a profound equilibrium, causing that mathematical proof, though luminous, though true, to be discarded. And perhaps this is why progress is taking so long. Too much weight placed on the doors of things, on their beginnings. How they entered. Why they came. Nothing allowed to just arrive and sit down, even into the blue district of dreams nothing immune to this pathological sourcing. I confess I often used you this way: as a front gate to the elaborate memory palace I was building, asking you to stand still as I tried to carve it around us out of the black granite night of our childhood. This way every theory, every mood, every image would have to be paraded through your wide archway first, to see if it was false, before I let it be filed as something that happened. The shimmers on Boon Lake in the morning when cartoons were playing. The peanut-butter cups we used to steal before breakfast. That birch we used to climb, that could not hold us. You thought I was taking your hand as we fell but really I needed a coördinate to touch in midair, to confirm where the ground was"}

My ex had left at the beginning of summer and Natalia wouldn’t move in until spring, so I lived alone that June in Richmond, in the back bottom suite of a shoebox-shaped fourplex set perpendicular to the street. In the story I’ve told for almost twenty years, I’m a junior in college towelling my wet hair as I walk from my bathroom through the hall, headed to my bedroom, at two in the morning. I notice a flicker of motion from the living- room window: a human hand flopping, like live tilapia, through the side panel’s bent vinyl, the limb shoved in up to the elbow. I charge at the arm, yell, I see you, motherfucker , and the hand jerks back. The man flees. When I call 911 and reach, incredibly, a busy signal, I phone Ed instead, who will drive over, remove his old A.C. unit, take it to his new place. Until Ed arrives, I hover near the pried-back vinyl gripping a butcher knife. I would’ve stabbed the hand that tried to steal my A.C.

Male, five hundred pounds, the bear was massive in front, and tapered toward the bare patch on the furred almost curly truculent rear. Such a hot midsummer, such a tired bear. He was like a god—so much space was filled with bear. Like a cumulonimbus come down to earth—a density of bear with blood in him, and teeth, and a bear liver and bear lights.

I did not expect another summer, another child, so much darkness. She trots away to catch it. Possibly nine minutes later, she lopes back, barely winded. There is the light in her cupped hands. She shows it off: look how it pulses. She will pass it to me. I can feel the little wind and the adamant wing against my palms. My life is almost over. I pass it back. She waves it up dramatically. We watch for a greenish spark. If the night is clear and we can stare up for a full minute, we are guaranteed to see a satellite, a star whose name I know—there are only five—a glittering meteor, a comet, or the glint of a plane headed to the Arctic. Those towering ghostly shapes must be the huge unmoving cumulus of late summer, the clouds Jesus referred to when he said “in my father’s house there are many mansions.” These close low humpbacked shapes must be the fishermen’s boats, hauled high and tarped. No lamps on the island. What light there is seems to come from under our sneakers. Now the fireflies are flashing in phase–you could parse it out, like the meter of a fugue. The plan is obvious: earth will become more and more beautiful until I can’t stand it. Then I will vanish. It will be in my mind that the skiffs are hauled up, safe from the wild tide; in my mind that the silly sleepless accordion plays “Sweet Lorraine,” over-sweet across deep water. I can’t see the child but she takes my pinkie, almost angrily. She will lead me back to Scoffield, counting our steps on the stony path. When we come to a million, we will be home."}

I missed it when the bright sloppy sun dipped down behind us and the park slipped right into that new-new dark as the city lights lit up like the spangled tips of hot cigarettes, cooing. I forgot about the six feet collapsing between us like prismatic bubbles breaking between us, between us the difficult gift (and guilt) of loneliness. What did it mean to be touched? It felt like I had never been. Oops! I hadn’t been kissed like that. That deep and deliberate. When is the last time someone wanted to suck and slurp you up through a straw from some glad underworld or some strange netherworld or any other world where thousands weren’t dying alone with flooded lungs? I didn’t care who saw us. I didn’t care that I might get sick. I didn’t care—I was such a reckless, selfish bitch. I know. You almost walked into the lake, but I was already drenched, happy and squealing like a feral pig inside. Do you like touching me ? I kept asking. You know I do . Do you like kissing me ? I kept asking. You know I do . You know I do—stop asking . Everything wanted to be touched and I wanted to scratch it all: Him. My face. My face most of all. He tenderly bit and tugged at my bottom lip, and I became a buoy, bobbing above the hazards. I slid my index finger in the crack at the corner of his smile like a little hook as we licked and puzzled the need and heat. Remember the cherry blossoms? (They’re gone now.) So quick in their delicate beauty and brief bloom. I remember I brought a thermometer in my purse and stuck it in his mouth like a wet wish—"}

When I set two plates for dinner, I could imagine my mother on her daily walk— careful, stiff-hipped, alone—to the mailbox, silence at each elbow, around her throat.

I don’t know what became of her. I drove to so many apartments in the day. America, this is really the very last thing. He’d stocked up, for our weekend together, on food he knew I would like. Vegetarian pad Thai, some black-bean-and-sweet-potato chili, coconut ice cream, a bag of caramel popcorn. Loads of Malbec.

The new missiles can detect a fly’s heartbeat atop a pile of rubble from six thousand miles away. That flies have hearts, one hundred and four cells big, that beat. And because of this knowing: a pile of rubble. The prophets came to participate in suffering as if to an amusement park, which makes our suffering the main attraction. In our brochure: a father’s grief over his dead father, the thorn broken off in a hand. My empire made me happy because it was an empire, cruel, and the suffering wasn’t my own."}

The sense of time floating in time, the effort to capture time in time, in verse, in the ancient rhythm of verse, not in my voice, but a timeless voice haunted by a timeless voice before it—rhythmic, keeping time to the world of trees and fields and fog resounding, as if a fog resounds— that is the effort of my art. Such as it is. It’s a plain thing, as plain as a field in early spring with two or three blurry symbols, composed almost completely of silence, because it’s there, the oldest art, and that’s what Turner painted, silence."}

When her heart failed suddenly, Kahlua— a paint the color of the Mexican liqueur and swaybacked like a hammock— went on a hunger strike. Fearing that he might die from loneliness, Jay and Linda heard about a donkey housed unhappily an hour north, whose spouse likewise had died. Donkeys are stoic, disguising their pain, and we know grief is pain. They hauled him home, installed him in the barn, to see if the widowers could get along, the Odd Couple of Central Vermont. Nickolai, a Slavic name, means “victorious; conqueror of the people,” and, if that’s so, he’s won us over, my husband and me, Jody and David, Cathy and Eric, and other long-marrieds of Peck Hill Road. Driving to town for groceries and gas, I shift my Subaru into neutral to admire our two old bachelor uncles free-ranging along the electric fence. Their partnership so far so good. Nickolai’s fur, mottled gray and white like burnout velvet, gets waterlogged when it rains; Kahlua’s is waterproof. Nickolai’s lovely floppy donkey ears are much larger than Kahlua’s, and he has a stiffer mane; his bray is not Kahlua’s pleasant whinny— his hee-haws, like a wheezing accordion, reverberate off our bedroom walls. I once saw Kahlua bare his teeth, like Mr. Ed, the TV horse who could talk. But they say that donkeys are more personable than horses. More affectionate than dogs. So it’s easy to forget that he’s a jackass— confined to the barn all freezing winter, tired of nipping at Kahlua’s flanks, he stomped Jay’s pet rabbit to death. From afar, you cannot tell which one’s the boss, albeit equal on the equine scale. On days when it isn’t thundering, you’ll find them both civilly ensconced, silhouettes grazing against the sunset, the moon rising over Max Gray Road. They stand head to tail, or tail to head, their long tails ticking metronomes, flicking flies away from the other’s eyes, their warm sides barely touching. Facing opposite directions, they’ll age in place, bickering, companionable— a photo on a country calendar.Jay and Linda moved to Plateau Road and brought with them a pair of horses: old Kahlua and his longtime mare.

I swear this is not my story. On our tombstones, what do we see? What we love most is always free and far irrational, fine with me. What is true today if not my teeth, my bones, my nothingness?

We move from cell to fingers, toes, our footprint handprint fingerprint alone identifies us as one person in this widening morgue; you men and women of generations, ever upward, we say now; if Whitman could, he’d hold us dear, our arms, our feet, our hands, our fingerprinted fingers wrapped in his— “myself disintegrated, every one disintegrated yet part of the scheme”— and renew us with varied meanings, rebellious curiosities; I will miss him in my future, if it is me, and in twenty or a hundred years, history will ask: How did we wear on with so much weeping? It was never so beautiful as this April in the park with yellow oaks deliriously blooming despite the trill of siren after siren to the east; we ignored it, walking west or north, southeast, any which way someone else wasn’t. Sunlight far-flung itself sideways across the arms-up oaks and Olmsted’s slopes; oh I was rapt, convinced this surreal afternoon was magic-cast in lavender and grass-green thickening itself, cardinals flying straight up into that vanishing we are all doing now, minding our eternities—transcendent limbo, this, but cherish the eclipse, our orbit moving over our polyphonic voices in fugue-walking choices, prelude to nothing, yes, nothing, because when the wind is all C major unravelling in D minor, we are in the neuro-beat of wondering who will stay today and who departs tomorrow, but here are my children, my coffin, my love, it doesn’t matter what color the coffin is or that we swooned too long in idioms; we broke on counterpoint and this is where it leads. I swear this is not my story. On our tombstones, what do we see? What we love most is always free and far irrational, fine with me. What is true today if not my teeth, my bones, my nothingness? Is it near? I must endear myself. I’ll think, oh, it wasn’t me, I was just a sentence after all. But my sentence: Was it wrong? I am young to be this old, too old to be that young. When we are all accounted for, someone will surely say: Unevenly I conclude we count facts because we cannot lose our minds in facts; we lose them in the vivid air, thousands elsewhere."}

Is there memory in the shade of a tree of a lynching fifty years ago, when I was nine? And do I love that tree? Love the sinner, not the sin. Forgive the electricity, not the singeing of genitals. The more I know about human nature the more I plan to be tall grass in a field. Until then I’ll tell my wife I love her in Toronto and Blacksburg and bed, in pajamas and bluejeans and song, in theory and fact and dream. I will not gouge a man’s eye out, I promise, yet the eye is out, the man is dead, and the geese I’m listening to have no idea that we’re as wild as the coyotes that would tear them apart. If given a choice I’d not choose to be human. If given a choice how to be human, I’d say like a glass of water. While I have no answers to the questions I don’t know to ask, I can love my wife in Detroit, in general, in detail, in vain, in spite, in depth, in the shallow light of the moon, in contrast to hating myself, in sympathy and in stealth, in time as a ghost and right now as a poet wondering if surgeons, during a transplant, tell the shivering and recycled heart it is loved. I assume so, but I’ve never asked a heart on its second time around, Were you christened, were you blessed, are you worth all this trouble"}

False locusts, Toads with falsettos, their chimes issuing below The low leaves &amp; petals. The harmonica playing Is so otherworldly, the boy blows with his eyes closed. Some tree-frog species spend most every day underground. They don’t know what sunlight does at dusk. They are nocturnal insectivores. No bigger than A green thumb, they are the first frogs to call In the spring. They may sound like crickets Only because they eat so many crickets. Tree frogs mostly sound like birds. The tree frog overcomes its fear of birds by singing. The harmonica playing is so bewitching, The boy gathers a crowd in a flea market In the Deep South. A bird may eat a frog. A fox may eat the bird. A wolf may eat the fox. And the wolf then may carry varieties of music And cunning in its belly as it roams the countryside. A wolf hungers because it cannot feel the good In its body. The people clap &amp; gather round With fangs &amp; smiles. The father lifts the son To his shoulders so the boy’s harmonics hover Over varieties of affections, varieties of bodies With their backs to a firmament burning &amp; opening. You can find damn near anything in a flea market: Pets, weapons, flags, farm-fresh as well as farm-spoiled Fruits &amp; vegetables, varieties of old wardrobes, A rusty old tin box with old postcards &amp; old photos Of lynchings dusted in the rust of the box. You can feel it on the tips of your fingers, This rust, which is almost as brown as the father And the boy on his shoulders &amp; the girl making The sound a tree frog makes in a flea market In the Deep South before the blood of dusk, Just before the last blood of dusk. Just before the dusk."}

Rigorous investigation has identified two dialects buzzing through the plunder-fall, hovering black bumblebees and overworked honeybees neck-deep in nectar-bliss, as the city to us, blundering against its oversaturated anthers until the pollen coats our skin, as if sugar-dusted, as if rolled in honey and flour to bake a cake for the queen, yes, she is with us, it is spring and this is her coronation, blossoming pear and crab-apple and cherry trees, too many pinks to properly absorb, every inch of every branch lusting after beauty. To this riot of stimuli, this vernal bombardment of the senses, I have capitulated without a fight. But not the beech tree. It never falters. It is stalwart and grounded and garlanded, a site-specific creation, seed to rootling to this companionable giant, tolerant and benign, how many times have I reflected upon their superiority to our species, the trees of earth? Reflection, self-reflection—my job is to polish the mirror, to amplify the echoes. Even now I am hard at work, researching the ineffable. I loafe and invite my soul , for Walt Whitman is ever my companion in New York, thronged carcass of a city in which one is never alone and yet never un-nagged-at by loneliness, a hunger as much for the otherness of others as for the much-sung self, for something somewhere on the verge of realization, for what lies around the corner, five or six blocks uptown, hiding out in the Bronx or across the river in Jersey. Somewhere on the streets of the city right now somebody is meeting the love of their life for the very first time, somebody is drinking schnapps from a paper sack discussing Monty Python with a man impersonating a priest, someone is waiting for the bus to South Carolina to visit her sister in hospice, someone is teleconferencing with the office back in Hartford, Antwerp, Osaka, someone is dust-sweeping, throat-clearing, cart-wheeling, knife-grinding, day-trading, paying dues, dropping a dime, giving the hairy eyeball, pissing against a wall, someone is snoozing, sniffling, cavorting, nibbling, roistering, chiding, snuggling, confiding, pub-crawling, speed-dating, pump-shining, ivy-trimming, tap-dancing, curb-kicking, rat-catching, tale-telling, getting lost, getting high, getting busted, breaking up, breaking down, breaking loose, losing faith, going broke, going green, feeling blue, seeing red, someone is davening, busking, hobnobbing, grandstanding, playing the ponies, feeding the pigeons, gull-watching, wolf-whistling, badgering the witness, pulling down the grill and locking up shop, writing a letter home in Pashto or Xhosa, learning to play the xylophone, waiting for an Uber X, conspiring, patrolling, transcending, bedevilling, testifying, bloviating, absolving, kibbitzing, kowtowing, pinky-swearing, tarring and shingling, breaking and entering, delivering and carting away, enwreathing lampposts with yellow ribbons, reading Apollinaire on a bench littered with fallen petals, waiting for an ambulance to pass before crossing First Avenue toward home. No wonder they fear it so intensely, the purists and isolationists in Kansas, the ideologues in Kandahar, it is a relentless negotiation with multiplicity, a constant engagement with the shape-shifting mob, diversely luminous as sunlight reflecting off mirrored glass in puzzle pieces of apostolic light. Certainly this is not the Eternal City but it is certainly Imperial, certainly tyrannical, democratic, demagogic, dynastic, anarchic, hypertrophic, hyperreal. An empire of rags and photons. An empire encoded in the bricks from which it was built, each a stamped emblem of its labor-intensive materiality, hundreds of millions barged down the Hudson each year from the clay pits of Haverstraw and Kingston after the Great Fire of 1835, a hinterland of dependencies, quarries and factories and arterial truck farms delivering serum to that muscular heart, a toiling collective of Irish sandhogs and Iroquois beam walkers and Ivoirian umbrella venders collecting kindling for the bonfire that has lured, like moths, the entire world to its blaze. As with my tree, the hubbub of bees its exaltation. Apis , maker of honey, Bombus , the humble bumbler, and the tree a common American beech. It rules the yard, overawing a straggling ailanthus hard against the wall of the Con Ed substation. Along the fence some scraggly boxwood shrubs, a table collapsed into rusted segments, two piles of bricks— what’s their story?—who made them, carted them, set them as a patio, and who undid that work to create these mundane, rain-eroded monuments to human neglect? Why does nobody tend this little garden? Undisciplined ivy scales the building in thick ropes and coils of porcelain berry vine, whose fruit will ripen to obscene brilliance come autumn, those strange berries, turquoise, violet, azure . . . Ah, I’ve lost my train of thought. Berries. The city. People, bricks, the past. Bees in a flowering beech tree. Symbiosis. Streams and webs and permutations, viruses replicating, mutating, evolving. Books in a library, bricks in a wall, people in a city. A man selling old golf clubs on the corner of Ludlow Street. A woman on the F train carefully rubbing ointment up and down her red, swollen arms. Acorns— tossing them into the Hudson River from a bench as I did when I was Peter Stuyvesant, when I was Walt Whitman, when we were of the Lenape and Broadway our hunting trail. Then the deer vanished, the docks decayed, the towers fell. The African graveyard was buried beneath concrete as the memory of slavery has been obscured by dogma and denial. The city speaks a hundred languages, it straddles three rivers, it holds forty islands hostage, it is an archipelago of memory, essential and insubstantial and evasive as the progeny of steam grates at dawn, a gathering of apparitions. The Irish have vanished from Washington Heights but I still see myself eating a cold pot-roast sandwich, watching “McHale’s Navy” on black-and-white TV in my grandmother’s old apartment. I remember the parties we used to throw on Jane Street, shots of tequila and De La Soul on the tape deck, everyone dancing, everyone young and vibrant and vivacious— decades later we discovered a forgotten videotape and our sons, watching with bemused alarm, blurted out, Mom, you were so beautiful! She was. We all were, everyone except the city. The city was a wreck and then it was a renovation project and now it is a playground of privilege and soon it will be something else, liquid as a dream. Empires come and go, ours will fade in turn, even the city will retreat, step by step, as the Atlantic rises against it. But water is not the end. Bricks are made of clay and sand and when they disintegrate, when they return to silt, new bricks will be made by hands as competent as ours. People will live in half-flooded tenements, people will live on houseboats moored to bank pillars along Wall Street. It’s all going under, the entire Eastern Seaboard. The capital will move to Kansas City but nobody will mourn for Washington. Someone will invent virtual gasoline. Someone will write a poem called “At the Ruins of Yankee Stadium” which will be set to a popular tune by a media impresario and people in Ohio will sing it during the seventh-inning stretch remembering, or imagining, the glory of what was. Time is with us viscerally, idiomatically, time inhabits us like a glass bowl filled with tap water at the kitchen sink, and some little pink stones, and a sunken plastic castle with a child’s face etched in a slate-gray window. Fish swim past, solemn as ghosts, and the child smiles sadly, wondering, perhaps, how bees will pollinate underwater. He seems a little melancholy. He must miss his old home, a skin-honeyed hive of multifarious humankind, a metropolis of stately filth doused in overrich perfume. The castle door swings open and the boy emerges like an astronaut stepping warily onto the moon.

I wanted to draw a doorway to walk through to get to the world of lilacs: purple, contagious green leaves and no movement but the steady invisible breathing of flowers. I knew I had to tell someone what I had done so I first walked to the park and stayed there until dusk, sitting on the glider or in the middle of the rusty and dangerous merry-go-round; I can’t remember which. When it was nearly dark I walked home, certain that they were worried and maybe even out looking for me. When I got there I saw them busy in the kitchen through the window, so I hid in the back yard until it was good and dark, a living thing on a swing set in the gloom, the attic in my head cracking open for the first time and I went in."}

I will not be there to surround you w/the past w/my ways of knowing—to save you—shall you be saved—from what— home from fighting are you, remembering how he or she or they looked at you while you both fed the machine or built the trough in dirt where it will be necessary to plant again—will it open—will the earth open—will the seeds that remain—will you know to find them in time—will those who have their lock on you let the openings which are chance unknowing loneliness the unrelenting arms of form, which knows not yet the form it will in the end be, open and form? Will there be islands. Will there be a day where you can afford to think back far enough to the way we loved you. Words you said for the first time as we said them. Mystery your grandfather said one day, after saying shhh listen to the birds &amp; you sat so still, all your being arcing out to hear, and the bird in its hiding place gave us this future, this moment today when you can recall— can you—his saying, there, that’s a mystery . And you said the word as if it were new ground to stand on, you uttered it to stand on it— mystery . Yes, mystery he said. Yes mystery you said talking to it now as it took its step out of the shadow into the clearing and there you saw it in the so-called in- visible. Then when the wave broke the first time on what had seemed terra firma and you knew as he held your hand insisting you hold your ground that there was foreclosure, there was oldness of a kind you couldn’t fathom, and there was the terrifying suddenness of the now. Your mind felt for it. It felt the reach from an elsewhere and a dip which cannot hold. Splash went the wave. Your feet stood fast. Your hem was touched. We saw you watch. We felt your hand grip but not to move back. Can you find that now now, wherever you are, even a candle would be a gift I know from there. Shhh he said so you could hear it. Pity he said not knowing to whom. Pity you said, laughing, pity pity , and that was the day of your being carried out in spite of your cold, wrapped tight, to see the evening star. And he pointed. And you looked up. And you took a breath I hear even now as I go out—the inhalation of dark secrecy fear distance the reach into an almost-touching of silence, of the thing that has no neighbors and never will, in you, the center of which is noise, the outermost a freezing you can travel his arm to with your gaze till it’s there. The real. A star. The earth is your home. No matter what they tell you now and what program you input via your chip or port or faster yet, no, no, in that now I am not there in, to point, to take your now large hand and say look, look through these fronds, hold your breath, the deer hiding from the hunter is right here in our field, it knows we are too, it does not fear us. Be still. Wait. And we, we will be left behind. Except just now. If you still once. That you might remember. Now. Remember now."}

The Elephant, for its huge size, which is an assault on human honor and dignity, shall be crossed off the list of existing beings, and its ongoing existence shall be considered an anomaly and a phantom. For economic, moral, political, and behavioral crimes, the polecat, fox, squirrel, badger, chipmunk, vole, jay, lark, raven and crow, deer and badger, kangaroo and its joeys, whale and shark, pike, swan and crab, and all their ilk shall be sentenced to various terms of punishment in various places, but with a strictly legal and individual approach to each specific case, such that no indiscriminate levelling and wholesale depersonalization take place. The Cockroach shall simply be sentenced to be shot; this needs no explanation. The Lion shall be sentenced to public humiliation and degradation, since it is clear that the king of animals, nature, and everything else is man. Rivers shall be sentenced to be redirected in all possible directions, as a result of which they shall run shallow and dry up—which is only fair. The Sun shall be sentenced to exposure and public repentance, with consequent removal from the lists of remembrance and glorification of anything beginning with the words: Long live! So it must be. Decisions for all the remaining cases are being prepared, and the sentences will be announced as they are decided within a reasonable period of time. None will be exempt. —Dmitri Prigov (1940-2007) (Translated, from the Russian, by Simon Schuchat with Ainsley Morse.) "}

We clutch our little candles from their cardboard cuffs, and mine keeps going out, Hope leaning over to help relight it. There are as many Elvises as Elvis fans, old and not so old and from the farthest reaches, rolling strollers, luggage, oxygen tanks; so many stick-on sideburns; so many ways to sweat. I don’t know it yet, but Hope’s blurred out on pills again. We both buy buttons with the lightning logo: Taking Care of Business in a Flash. One too-tall Elvis strums a ukulele, strolling up and down the line along the gates and nodding solemnly, the crowd just slightly hushed. Hope says, Can you imagine being loved this much ?"}

We were driving home when we saw the flashlights telling us to slow, the road impassable. It was then I lost my glasses climbing over a downed tree, and when we reached our house I called my neighbor, not yet home from work, to tell him his tree had fallen and, at first, he thought it had fallen on his house, as if he already saw our oak glancing off his roof a year later during the ice storm, when it seemed every oak in the neighborhood fell at the same moment. By then, our neighbor had enough wood and so we cut our old oak and hauled it up the road. All our ricks are overflowing now, filled with oak and four fir trees that died over four summers due to drought or sunburn, the man who cut them down said, the consequence, no doubt, of the woods in front of us being clear-cut to build a house free of the hazards of trees. Today, I had jury duty and the D.A. asked me if I thought economic hardship could impact a relationship and I said yes, I certainly did.

I should have known what I’d said was enough for the defense attorney to want me gone from that grim room where the jurors’ chairs did not face the defendant, accused of harming two people who shared his name, and the bailiff’s shoes were scuffed and the judge seemed to be looking at his computer screen most of the time. And when I picked up my belongings to go, even as the judge was thanking me, I hurried, feeling as if I’d done something wrong, to the door, where I realized I didn’t know how I’d gotten there because the bailiff had led us, so for a while I walked down hallways where each door opened to a courtroom where people’s lives were changing one way or the other.

We were so small, but I wanted to know how it felt: my hand raised high across the opposite shoulder, slicing down like a trapeze. Her face caught my hand. I’d slapped her in our yellow room with circus animals on the curtains. I don’t remember how it felt. I was a rough child. I said No . I said These are my things . I was speaking, usually, of my socks: white, athletic, thin and already gray on the bottom, never where I left them. I was speaking of my fists raining down on my brother’s back. My sister’s. Socks. In the fourth grade, in California, I kicked Charles in the testicles. At that school, we played sock ball: hit the red playground ball with the sides of our hands and ran the bases. I kicked Charles with the top of my foot, caught him in the hinge of ankle. I wanted to see what would happen. I didn’t believe anything could hurt like it did on TV. Charles folded in half at the crease of his waist. My god, I was a rough child, but I believed Charles, that my foot turned him to paper. Later, I kicked my dad the same way, but he did not crumple.

My dad was a star collapsing. The first thing a dying star does is swell, swallows whatever is near. He tried to take us into his body, which was the house the police entered. This is how I knew he was dying. I’d called the police. What is your name ? He tried to put us through the walls of the house the police entered, which was his body. What is your name ? Compromised: the integrity of a body contracting. What is your name, sir ? He answered: Cronos . He answered: I’m hungry . He answered: A god long dead . He threw up all his children right there on the carpet. After all, we were so small, the children. The thing about a star collapsing is that it knows neither that it is a star nor in collapse. Everything is stardust, everything essential. What is your name ? Everything is resisting arrest. Its gravity crushes the children and the cruiser’s rear passenger window. The officer didn’t know the star’s name. White dwarf? Black hole? To see: throw the collapsing star face first into anything. Face first into the back seat. Face first into the pepper spray. Face first onto the precinct lawn. Did you know you could throw a star? Do you understand gravity, its weaknesses? You are in my house. You should already know my name. Once, I slapped my sister with the back of my hand. We were so small, but I wanted to know how it felt: my hand raised high across the opposite shoulder, slicing down like a trapeze. Her face caught my hand. I’d slapped her in our yellow room with circus animals on the curtains. I don’t remember how it felt. I was a rough child. I said No . I said These are my things . I was speaking, usually, of my socks: white, athletic, thin and already gray on the bottom, never where I left them. I was speaking of my fists raining down on my brother’s back. My sister’s. Socks. In the fourth grade, in California, I kicked Charles in the testicles. At that school, we played sock ball: hit the red playground ball with the sides of our hands and ran the bases. I kicked Charles with the top of my foot, caught him in the hinge of ankle. I wanted to see what would happen. I didn’t believe anything could hurt like it did on TV. Charles folded in half at the crease of his waist. My god, I was a rough child, but I believed Charles, that my foot turned him to paper. Later, I kicked my dad the same way, but he did not crumple.

The sleeves Drooped well below the fingertips. It gave you room to grow into. Years loomed. Day after day, summer after summer, days were immeasurably longer then, And the one tin bathful of hot water did the several children one after the other. Then it seemed in no time at all you were into your teens. Because your birthday Fell a week before Christmas—December the 18th—you’d have to make do With the merest token of a family present. A set of bath salts, maybe, or a bar Of lemon soap the simulacrum of a lemon, and we tried to remember If such a thing came wrapped in tissue paper like the fruit itself, or was it See-through cellophane? Then to summon up the names of yesteryear— Yardley’s April Violets; Morny White Heather; Lenthéric Tweed! It’s the 1960s, And I see myself wondering what would be appropriate to buy for my mother, Dazzled by the cornucopian Christmas window display of the chemist’s shop. All this, believe it or not, was apropos of Angela Hackett’s painting— Because when looking at a thing we often drift into a memory of something else, However tenuous the link. Five years and more—ever since I bought it For your birthday—it’s been hanging on our bedroom wall, pleasing us To look at it from time to time to see different things in it. Only now has it Occurred to us to talk about or of it at this length, the lemons—three of them— Proceeding in an anticlockwise swirl from pale lemon to a darker yellow To an almost orange, tinged with green—degrees, we speculate, of ripeness Or decay. You know how lemons, if left too long in the bowl, one or two from time To time will show a blush of green, a dimple or a bruise of bluish green That overnight becomes a whitish bloom? So we think Angela Hackett’s lemons Might be on the turn. Though it’s possible the green tinge might be an echo Of the two limes I haven’t mentioned until now, nestled in against the lemons On the indigo-and-white Moorish plate, all of which complicates the picture. It gave us pause for thought. How long does it take, we wondered, for a lemon To completely rot? We imagined a time-lapse film, weeks compressed Into seconds, the lemon changing hue, developing that powdery bloom, then Suddenly collapsing into itself to leave a shrunken, pea-size, desiccated husk— The flesh evaporated, breathed into the atmosphere as it transpires. And that is why on the 26th of March, 2019, we set up the lemon experiment. On the avocado-and-aubergine-colored Moroccan saucer we bought in Paris We set a fresh lemon and a banana, whose peel, we are led to believe, releases Ethylene gas and hence ripens any other fruit with which it comes into contact. We wanted to see with our own eyes the end of the life cycle of the lemon. I write this on the 6th of April. The banana has gone black except at the tips. The lemon looks as fresh as ever. We’ve just been for our daily walk around The Waterworks. Ducks are kicking up a racket. A blackbird sings From a blackthorn bush.

I have seen nothing. It is deafening. It shakes with laughter with ways of looking. It rattles. Listen. How much is it now the thing I want? The soft wind is it recompense? But I was trying to tell you about us now. How we finally realized we made no difference. And the visible we love. Its notes its intervals. Over which the sunlight still proceeds shivering with precision. With the obligation of precision. The visible whose carapace we love. And how our love is that we are seen . All the way into the mind are seen . The earth with its fingers in our mouth nose ears. The visible with its ghosts its smooth utmosts. And weight and limit—how they heave up—pray for us we are destroyers— pray we fail—the mind must fail— but still for now a while longer let me who am part of it &amp; must fail &amp; the pieces which must not fall where they may , they must not, as all is hearing this from the deep future, deep origin . . . Cry. Cry mind sick with the delight of getting it always only right. Cry fingering the earth every crevice. Cry all the trees like a problem you can solve. How could you not have maintained steady state. It is lean this unfolding of your days over this earth. Listen, a flap where a gate shuts, where the next step is coldly placed without hope—&amp; crackles rising where your footfall goes—oh I am huge—I would take back names give up the weight of being give up place delete there delete possess , go, love, notice, shape, drift, to be in minutes once again, in just one hour again. Look my small hand comes out of my pocket asking to touch one more time. Without taking. To touch. To not take away any sensation any memory. To come to the feeling-about at the edge of the object and stay. Release focus. Release shape. If we back off release blind ourselves thumb away hope . . . But I am huge."}

So here I am listening To the tick of my mechanical aortic valve—overhearing, rather, the way it flits In and out of consciousness. It’s a wonder what goes on below the threshold. It’s quiet up here, just the muted swoosh of the cars on the Antrim Road, And every so often the shrill of a far-off alarm or the squeal of brakes; But yesterday some vandal upended the terra-cotta pot of daffodils In our little front garden, that’s not even as big, when I consider it, As the double bed I’m lying on. Behind the privet hedge, besides the daffodils There’s pansies, thyme, and rosemary. A Hebe bush. A laurel. Ruefully I scuffed the spilled earth and pebbles with my shoe and thought of Poussin— Was it Poussin?—and his habit of bringing back bits of wood, stones, moss, Lumps of earth from his rambles by the Tiber; and the story of him Reaching among the ruins for a handful of porphyry and marble chips And saying to a tourist, “Here’s ancient Rome.” So, here’s Glandore Avenue. So different now from thirty years ago, the corner shop at the interface Torched and the roadway strewn with broken glass and rubble. There was something beautiful about the tossed daffodils all the same. I’d never really taken them under my notice these past few difficult weeks. It’s late March, some of them beginning to turn and wilt and fade, heads Drooping, papery at the tips, desiccated, or completely gone, reduced to calyx. So many shades of yellow when you look at them. Gorse. Lemon. Mustard. Honey. Saffron. Ochre. But then any word you care to mention has so many Shades of meaning, and the flower itself goes by different names. Narcissus. Daffadowndilly. Lent lily. So we wander down the road of what it is we think We want to say. Etymologies present themselves, like daffodil from asphodel— Who knows where the “d” came from?—the flower of the underworld. They say it grows profusely in the meadows of the dead, like a buttercup On its branching stem. And I see a galaxy of buttercups in a green field, And the yellow of the tall sunflowers in Monet’s “Garden at Vétheuil” that flank The path where the woman and the two children stand commemorated. Strange how a smear of color, like a perfume, resurrects the memory Of another, that which I meant to begin with. “Asphodel, that greeny flower.” I’d just found the book I had in mind—“What Painting Is,” by James Elkins— When the vandal struck. Thud . What the . . . ? The gate clanged. I looked out The bay window to see a figure scarpering off down the street to the interface . . . What a book, though. I have it before me, open at this color plate, jotting Notes into a jotter, which I’ll work up later into what you’re reading now. “The detail I’m reproducing here is a graveyard of scattered brush hairs And other detritus,” says Elkins. “At the centre left, glazed over by Malachite Green, Are two crossed brush hairs, one of them bent almost at a right angle. Just below them are two of Monet’s own hairs, fallen into the wet paint.” Brushstrokes laid down every which way. Jiggles. Jabs. Impulsive Twists and turns. Gestures that “depend on the inner feelings of the body” And “the fleeting momentary awareness of what the hand might do next.” You listen to the body talking, exfoliating itself cell after cell. I saw it Happening just now in the dust motes drifting through this ray of sunlight. So everything gets into the painting, wood smoke from the studio stove, The high pollen count of a high summer’s day en plein air by the Seine. The detail is so magnified it is impossible to tell what it is of, if you didn’t, Like Elkins, know. The visual field looks like a field. Shades of umber, khaki, mud, And other greens beside the Malachite. It could stand for anything, it seems, In Monet’s garden—or “Garden,” rather—as Poussin’s handful of porphyry Is Rome and of the days of the fall of Rome. I want it to go to the stately tune Of a Poussin painting, “Landscape with a Man Washing His Feet at a Fountain,” Say, where a woman sweeps by, balancing a basket on her head, and an old man In blue dreams full-length on the grass. There are milestones and tombs, And puddles on the road, and you can just imagine the whispering of the cistern. A line of blue hills in the distance is contoured like a monumental sentence. It’s beautiful weather, the 30th of March, and tomorrow the clocks go forward. How strange it is to be lying here listening to whatever it is is going on. The days are getting longer now, however many of them I have left. And the pencil I am writing this with, old as it is, will easily outlast their end.So different now from thirty years ago, the corner shop at the interface Torched and the roadway strewn with broken glass and rubble.

I’m here about the widow Afraid of butterflies. A widow knows ruin may be As comprehensive as “rain,” a kind of cover For the dirt about the dead. Nature does not destroy Only change. Get down on your knees &amp; pray And get up quickly &amp; live to celebrate that. Falling is the first &amp; most important skill in many things. How to fall without breaking as well as how to break. Tell me what you pray when you are broken or break."}

But we left that haven the same night because my husband didn’t believe in hospitals, the baby naked, wrapped only in a blanket because we both believed in skin to skin. Because the baby cried, but wouldn’t suck. Because when I started to stand I started to faint so I had to crawl to the sterile diapers and pale-yellow sleeper folded inside the brown paper bag I’d baked in the oven. Because I’m still there on my hands and knees, deflated belly and ripe breasts, huge dark nipples, tearing open the stapled bag, fumbling the ducky pins, two fingers slipped between the baby’s belly and the thick layers of cotton, the sharp point. The baby, a stranger, yet so strangely familiar, flecks of blood still stuck to her scalp. Because my husband slept beside me and I let him sleep. Because it would be years before I left him.

I wrote a check, the date October 18 without the year, to Theresa Monrose for a hundred dollars, I did not write the amount longhand.

I don’t get it right, I leave off years, the everyday debt made clear by saying something like thank you, in a handwritten letter. Yes, I believe everyone’s time of day or night is different. I’m sure a poet I love, who demanded punctuality, never bounced a check. When he died, age 66, at the Altenburgerhof Hotel, he did not pay his bill. I guarantee the world will pay for his empty Zimmer a hundred years. I can’t get Siegfried’s Funeral March out of my ears"}

Let it be always a stranger she walks wide around. I fantasize about outer space as if I have some relation to it besides being an animal in its zoo. No visitors. No matter how far I travel on earth I wind up sitting in rooms. Wind up running all over towns and streets the same. Then get hungry as anywhere, again. Going anyplace, I think: I never want to go home and I can’t wait to be home. All travelling’s a way to imagine having a home to leave or return to. The shame of never leaving home. The anguish of no home. Changing house keys on the unchanged ring. The ring is the home, the thing inside trees. Claiming a tree “mine.” Car feels like a pod, an exoskeleton, a place inside me. Car short for “carapace.” I blame the weather, blame myself if the weather is “nice.” Tell myself the weather ruined my plans, though it’s me ruined the weather’s. Plan: like plane like plain like pain/pane. Like planet. Plan acting like an overlay on everything most elemental. Trying to make everything go according to it—feelings, food, flight, ordinariness, the very earth. Stop already. Stop as if you can. As if you can breathe back in your own baby, your two, your three. Breathe out all the ones you never had. Breathe in one two three. Breathe out all the others. I don’t want to be cremated. I want to be part of earth. Space may be my original home but I only remember here. I cling to this life. I’ve taped myself to it like a card on a gift. Happy birthday! Many happy returns and hope it’s lots of fun! We miss you! Love, Me. A gift is always an exchange of energy. Like water boiling, like photosynthesis. Inside the box is a water pitcher and a picture of us together as we were when the photo was taken. Now it’s given. It’s only a copy, but the original was a moment and was burned up, caloric. Simone says before bed, “I’m imagining a strawberry automatically drawn. I dream so much when I’m awake.” When I learned to tell time I told it. I told it so; I stopped listening to what it tried to tell me: You’re already losing everything as you go and go and go."}

With a thirty-pound sack of rice on my head, all day I danced on a stone balustrade without falling off. From sunup to sundown, week after week, I was a whole amusement park unto myself.

Noho Star is closed now &amp; Cecil died yesterday. I walked to Union Square &amp; watched black men playing chess. Rubbing their jaws while the afternoon light poured down the gentle rooks of their fingers hanging above a queen or pawn. Cecil Taylor sat across the table from me. Wearing leather gym shorts, rainbow-striped kneesocks, a fringe vest, &amp; a face so musical I could hear the notes blunting &amp; banging as he low-laughed &amp; looked like a lion who had bitten off the ancient secret of a soft roar. I liked him right away. Said yes when he asked me if I would share a dessert with him. I in an ivory dress that was vintage, the kind my mother would have worn, with chiffon sleeves—the shining air made the loose dress cling to me. The way a special music clung to Cecil Taylor, followed the radical swing &amp; swag of his voice. Do you want to have the Heart of Darkness together, he said. That looks sweet enough. I remembered later when we stood on the sidewalk, sugar &amp; poetry in us. Heat coming off the summer night in the city always made me feel I could never leave New York. He kissed my cheeks. Said he had been fooled. I didn’t think they made women like you anymore. Tipped his cowboy hat &amp; took off his sunglasses. My god, in the dark his eyes burned so clear &amp; wild I thought the sun was out, roaring through our hearts like a song, daring its hunter to aim"}

Fated to bear witness to such confident accretion, my life was bitten down into a point that pointed toward the dome, its whole shorn forest brought to thatch, incredibly, by teeth. There is a seal that spends each morning blunting its incisors on the ice— rasping open breathing holes that close if not routinely shaven back— until one day its teeth, now dull and domed, stop breaking through, the animal beating its soft enamel on the ceiling as it drowns. There can be no proceeding from. There is only gnawing through the visible, wearing down the center between living and its damages, until the center’s broken door stops granting us admission to our lives. The beavers graft another layer on the dam. They slap their tails so loud a sound like falling dice skitters the smooth, unfrozen surface of the pond. Or what had been the pond before it overflowed its banks and drowned the meadow and the campsite and the fire pit we used to turn our spits over, the tusky wooden tapers of our spits. I was born in time to see it swamp, my life a parallel, accumulative loss of definition. If I am still enough, the beavers will reveal their door, the jamb of which they clot into a lodge before my eyes, the underwater hatch through which their chambered penetralia take shape. My ways, my mammal acumen, are forgeries of theirs— to have been underwater all that time, salient to the outer world only as a dome, before tearing through the doorway of that world, loud and blue and sure my life was mine.I was born to watch the beavers’ chewing flood the pond.

A lifetime later, it is clear to me, or at least less murky: I understand Earl as a harbinger from an undiscovered land. White gloves and can of polish; courtesy. “Don’t fall down, now!” he’d admonish me. Why should I fall? I wondered. I was five, six, seven. I was agile and alive. I roller-skated up and down outside Grant’s Tomb or on Riverside Drive. It was the old ladies (these were the Fifties) teetering along on their high heels, hatted and gloved, with seams in their stockings, and with glassy-eyed fox furs draped over their massive chests, who might fall down, not me. Was it because it would have been rude to warn them that Earl kept warning me? Mortality has caught up with those ladies and with him, rattled their doorknobs (it was time); gone in.

We drank in the bars where everyone knew you and the Southwest summer burned through and then there were months in which I tried to escape, your drowning like a clasp around my throat. I fled in the night. Years passed. In the dry climates, there is less of an odor. There was no sign of the dog when they found you dead in your chair: it had been days. I thought of the woman in Croatia, lying dead for decades in her apartment. No one to find her. Find you. There was a word for you back then, mischievous in that one picture— when we went to the mountains, your body woke up from the mysterious illness—alert fawn, a boy body freed momentarily from a terrible girlhood. Which is not to say you would ever have wanted to be a man. Which is not to say I could have saved you.I did not find the body. It was wintertime where I was; women gathered in bars. Their bodies like bare trees, naked arms giving fruit to hands in gestures. Ice was everywhere. I could still feel the command of your hands around a woman’s waist when two-stepping—it was the only time you wore joy. Your anger muscular in your small tired body that always hurt.

Whatever else, my friend, spreading wide his arms, looks out at the river and says, “After all, what choice did I have?” After all, I saw the man walking who’d had the stroke, saw the woman whose body won’t stop shaking. I saw the frog in the tall grass, boldly telling us who truly matters. I saw the world proclaim itself an unlit vesper candle while a crow flew into the tip of it, sleek black match, burning."}

But Ovid swapped them in the tale, So that the sister who was forced Becomes instead the nightingale, Who sings as though her heart would burst. It’s Ovid’s stories that prevail. And so the swallow is divorced Twice from her voice, her tuneless chatter, And no one asks her what’s the matter. These swallows, though, don’t have the knack For sorrow—or we’d not have guessed— Though smartly dressed in tailored black, Spend no time mourning, do not rest. One scissors forth, one zigzags back, They take turns settled on the nest Or waiting on a perch nearby To zero in on wasp or fly.

Do the houses I’m passing Regard me as a creature about to vanish Into the realm of shadow while they have resolved To hold their ground? But the bottle I’m carrying Shows how the past can enhance the present. The grapes it was made from were plucked and pressed Seven years ago in a vineyard in Burgundy According to customs already in place for generations By the time these houses moved from the realm Of blueprints and estimates into brick and wood. The bottle will testify that traditions once honored Are being adhered to still, with patience, with pride. And if the past is present this evening, isn’t the future Present as well in the thought that the ritual I’m helping to pass along will prove enduring, That however much the world around it may alter, Guests will still perform it in eras to come?

In the parking lot, Are you asleep ? says the boy who is not my boyfriend, running his fingers along the band of my underwear. Across the street from this, for years, an ancient tortoise roams the floor of the pet store, closing his army-green beak around the red toenails of sandalled women, thinking them strawberries.

Choked quiet, as life unfolds its sticky wings in me. Snuffing me sweetly. Isn’t this love? To walk hand in hand toward the humid dark, enter the ghost web of the hungry, to consider some wants were not meant to be understood. Some women. The way my brother prays I’ll still find a man to divine me, and my father tells me lazy women will never be loved. Like today’s new trumpet pushing its bright flower in my slutty way. The slow voice of its angel hissing breathless: No. He is not here. He is not here. He is nowhere."}

In another life, he was from Somalia Where he spent hours watching clouds In shapes of feral acrobats tipping along their tightropes Spun of camels’ hair and jute. His eyes were liquid, kind. His lashes each as long as a hummingbird’s tongue. His fetlocks puffed from galloping, his tail curled upward From the joy of feeling fleet across the tinted grasslands And the gold savannahs there. Do you find me colorful as well? Once, in another life in the Serengeti, he stretched his neck To feed on the acacia twigs, mimosa, wild apricot. He was gentle and his heart was as long As a human’s arm. At night, the others of his species hummed to each other across The woodlands there; no one knows how, exactly, to this day, But you can hear their fluted sounds. Pliny the Elder wrote that, In the circus of the hunting-theatres of ancient Greece, He would be safe. He was considered among the curiosities. The House of the Medici found him novel, And he pleased them mightily. Do you find my story pleasing, too? Even on the ship to France, The sailors cut an oblong hole Through the deck above the cargo hold to allow his head To poke safely through. When he arrived they dressed him in royal livery To walk the seven hundred leggy kilometres From Marseilles to Paris to be presented To the Queen Who fed him rose petals from her hand. At Thebes, in the tomb of the Valley of the Kings, He was depicted in a hieroglyph, his forelegs gently tethered By two slaves with a green monkey clinging to his neck like a child Just along for the ride. Do you think I have imagined this? In a woodblock, once In an early-Netherlandish world, He is shown with a crocodile, a unicorn, and a wobbly man With a tail and prehensile feet. Once, in Khartoum, He bent his neck low enough to take milk from a pewter bowl Held by a Sudanese farmer’s son. Centuries later, In Piccadilly Circus, he was excluded from the Carrousel; Everyone favored him, but no one could climb that high. If you come back from the other world, to this— The sky in Denmark, in its reticulated weathers, is inky On most days in February now. In the Copenhagen Zoo they only name the animals who grow Old there, and, in this life, they called him Marius but he was just a two-year-old. In that moment was he looking at a gray, cobbled Steeple in the middle distance of a dome Or thinking of a time when his life was circled by a mane Of warmth in a bright Numidian sun? His belly was full And his eyes closed slightly His lashes casting long Pink shadows on his face. Do you think I made this up? The attending veterinarian, Mads Bertelsen, shot him only once. He needed badly to be culled—his genetic type and character Replicated quite tidily enough already there, said Bengt Holst, Director of the Zoo. On that same day, After mid-noon tea and biscuits at their schools, The Danish children were ushered to the habitat in the Gardens, So they could learn firsthand About anatomy. The keepers cut him open to reveal his neck, his tongue, his heart (Which weighed just shy of twenty pounds). The children, wound in down, bound in bright wool scarves Which covered their open mouths with horizontal stripes, Were mittened, wide-eyed, curious. Do you find me curious as well?

Now we walk and walk through the orchards, the Cannery Orchard, the Nursery Orchard, the Black Cherry Orchard. We walk to the river, the far boundary, high and wide, deep and brown, a ganglia of branches tumbling, shooting down the rapids, then caught by the branch of a downed tree. There’s a man sitting on a bench aiming a long lens, an old couple walking who stop to pet our young dog. The Nursery Orchard makes me think of how the decisions quieted, moved on, how long ago I’d take those tests in secret, and, never the right color, I thought it was him. Later I found out it was both of us, and, oddly, that made it better, our decision made. The young trees in this orchard were grown for transplant, or maybe they just took cuttings, because now they’re as gnarled as the tree in the meadow they call the Wedding Tree, which was split in a storm, its fallen branches scattered around the still living base. It’s the Goat Orchard I keep wondering about, though—did the goats run there the way the dogs do now in their endless loops? Last night I saw a photo of goats standing in the branches of a tree they climb to eat its nuts. At first they looked much too heavy to ride the branches, ten of them standing in the same tree, and then they looked as light as horned birds. So, yes, the decisions lessen but the problems remain, the one about the heart, the way it rises. The one about finding your way to it as if walking in a maze of so many orchards each one needs a name.There were problems to be solved then, decisions to be made.

And then the galleons want to shop in the mall in the suburbs. Everything they see there is like the secrets they once carried in their holds.

And then the galleons want to visit the boy who loves making model boats in the basement that his parents have given up to his hobby. Wearing a magnifying visor, at a table with glues and tweezers and exact bits of wood, the boy puts together long ships and carracks in exquisite minute scale. The galleons approve of the galleon he has been making for months, imagining the huge tonnage of the actual ships, their cannons arrayed on the sides like judges. And then the galleons, on certain other days, want to go back to the forests they came from, to reel the blood-soaked narrative back to the stands of pines and oaks that will become their keels and decking, hulls and masts. Back to the mountains being mountains, their iron in the ground like gray thoughts. Back to the birds being birds.

Winter could come again, and pause The sky like a taped tactical descent Of pocket paratroopers. Things to see Could happen yet, and life prove not quite spent But still abundant, still the main event. The trick, I’m learning, is to stay in doubt, Season to season, of what time might bring, And patiently await how things turn out. Eventually time tells you everything. If it takes time to do so, no surprise In that. You fold your arms, you scan the skies, And tell yourself that life has made you wise, If only by the way it ebbs away. But still it takes an age, and after all, Though nearly gone, life didn’t end today, And you might be here when the first leaves fall Or even when the snow begins again, If life that cast you, when this all began, As a small boy, still needs a dying man.The trick, I’m learning, is to stay in doubt, Season to season, of what time might bring, And patiently await how things turn out.

I always used to think I loved my toes, a quarter of my bones splayed into fans, the nerves so bright and easy to please. A friend’s daughter showed me the bones she’d filed in an old card catalogue. I handed each one back, the dull heat of rot traded for the glare-white of a bare rib, fleshless cradle of hip, heft of femur on a mantel. She and I shared our love of lemons, and she taught me “witch” in her made-up language so I could call myself by the proper word. The invented one. I held myself against the hard belly of those vowels, that black glyph of a name. The pulse I once felt when my son turned inside me thrummed against my hand. Tonight, the splinter I let live in my thumb finally worked its way out of my flesh, the wound larger than the weapon. I asked my son which part of his life he loved most. He said crying. Because it felt so good to stop when he was happy again. The daughter shows me the thin hair of roots whitening the soil in a jar. She has made this small wilderness and given it life. When my marriage was failing, I offered to take care of my friend’s succulent. It was almost winter. Everything was going gray. So when the plant began to bloom I welcomed its dusty pollen until the kitchen smelled like carrion and bone dust. The house grew heavy with need, with an ache I understood. The smell of death was simple to answer. I knew what those fetid yellow stars required. I opened the back door to invite the flies to their desire.I asked my son which part of his body he loved most.

And I can yet remember when I hung it, in a better time Well antecedent to this rhyme. So come on in! The light is lit, The dark still can’t encompass it; A vast supply of grateful gladness, Above the current badness/madness, Prompts us to spread good will promiscuous And warmest greetings all Christmas-cuous! So, dearest critics, wince away As I shout-out, this holiday, The Khizr Khans, that Gold Star clan, And kind Pope Francis, holy man, And Meryl Streep and S. E. Cupp— May all find joy that fills them up! For Mayor Rahm Emanuel And Judge Gonzalo Curiel, May this unskillful doggerel Renew for them the annual Season’s felicitations! And to our neighbor nations: O Canada, I hope you know The gem you have in your Trudeau; And Mexico, I promise you We’re not all crazy, just a few. While lambent beams celestial gleam Across the continent in streams, I raise a toast to both O’Donnells, (Lawrence, Rosie), Mitch McConnell (Fooled you! NOT!), Mika Brzezinski, Whoopi Goldberg, Dan Lipinski, Myeshia Johnson, Charles Lane, Linc Chafee, and Meghan McCain. Now I will do my Santa shtick For Q.B. Colin Kaepernick, And belt a coupla carols with Josh Norman and Za’Darius Smith. Such strong good wishes do I bear For Marshawn Lynch and Jylan Ware And all the other N.F.L.-ers (Kneeling, sitting, standing fellers)— May Christmas bless them, every one! (Each young enough to be my son.) Look out! Your bard becomes verklempt. So let me bring some treats to tempt Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Joe McQuaid, The venders who were never paid, Lisa Belkin, Nikki Haley, All those who take Xanax daily, Serge Kovaleski, Penn Jillette, Ms. Midler (the resplendent Bette), Snoop Dogg, Chuck Todd, and Charles Blow, Ruth Marcus and the Navajo.

Thick wooden plugs pierce his lobes and his sunglasses testify to the radiance haloed around him. I’m so jealous. As I often am. It’s a kind of obsession. I want him to have been my child’s father. I want to have married a man who wanted to be in a body, who wanted to live in it so much that he marked it up like a book, underlining, highlighting, writing in the margins, I was here. Not like my dead ex-husband, who was always fighting against the flesh, who sat for hours on his zafu chanting om and then went out and broke his hand punching the car. I imagine when this galloping man gets home he’s going to want to have sex with his wife, who slept in late, and then he’ll eat barbecued ribs and let the baby teethe on a bone while he drinks a cold dark beer. I can’t stop wishing my daughter had had a father like that. I can’t stop wishing I’d had that life. Oh, I know it’s a miracle to have a life. Any life at all.

We love—but cannot take too much of each other. Yet she is the one who, when I asked her to kill me if I no longer had my mind— we were on our way into Ross, shopping for dresses.

But this is now. This is N.Y.C. I go to Clive. We meet in a diner and queue for the breakfast special. Clive’s British. He tries to make the large Hispanic short-order cook appreciate “underdone” French toast. “My wife told me not to say soggy ,” says Clive. We pay. Currie shows up. We sit and talk of Clive’s upcoming trip to Guantánamo, where, although he’s visited thirty-six times, they’re questioning (this time) his signature. He laughs. His current client, a Moroccan man, has been cleared for release and also informed he will never leave. Clive, a lawyer, questions the logic of this. He laughs again, then says, “I shouldn’t laugh,” then tells more stories. “Evidence” at Guantánamo is often supplied by snitches. Recently the same snitch brought evidence against three hundred different people. Clive wondered about his motives and did some research. It turns out every time he snitched he was allowed to visit the “love shack” where the Americans show porn. Clive plans to question the number three hundred on statistical grounds. Most people know only three hundred people in the whole world, demographers say. If you think like a lawyer you look for the limits of wisdom in facts like that. His French toast arrives. “Is it underdone?” I ask. He sighs and tells more stories, of his son at home who’s obsessed with “The Goon Show.” I don’t think like a lawyer. I’m looking to see how the sacred oaks come whispering through a man like Clive, now striving for people on death row or places like Gitmo for thirty-five years, but worried his son doesn’t see the proper merits of “Monty Python” or grasp its direct descent from the Goons. I imagine a laughing, squabbling family back home in Wexford. Clive looks at his watch. I take his scraps of French toast to the trash. We’ll meet again. He likes the idea (Currie’s idea) of travelling around Pakistan with a troupe of square dancers. Because the square dance is a “greeting dance” and we need more greeting! Clive smiles and goes up the street in his saggy-butt pants, looking not much like a high-powered lawyer, and the limits of wisdom remain, well—as perhaps we, who tend to confuse the greetings of dogs and gods, prefer limits to do—more or less where they were"}

From the bank he says I look like him. As for myself I only think of how to stand upright with water hardening one second round my ankles, and the next uprooting me as though I have no purchase on the world. My father shouts, Don’t fight it. I obey. I let the deluge settle round my heart then lay me on my back and carry me round the long sweep beyond my father’s sight. 10. Those roofless kennels where the nettles shake their fine-haired leaves and tiny bright-green buds. That almost buried path of blood-red bricks confined both sides by tiles shaped like rope. The ruined square of cracked disrupted blocks where once a summerhouse had turned and stared. These are the former glories of the house although I like their fall and brokenness much more than grieving for a time I missed.

The white speck says there is a light source that shines day and night far from a balcony on which an audience waits to see us open our doll eyes and close them again. I keep my face facing front to see every last thing that is coming. What is coming is this: a hat to be worn when taking a train, a compact in a pocket, a letter in a pocket, two hands, a waterfall pouring its contents into a well-worn shuddering mind. I’m as devoted to knowing as the dim fish swimming in an ever-widening circle. Today outraced the latest hour of midnight, my hat tells you that. That and that I strangely resemble you: eyes, nose, lips that refuse to open, knowing the face is glass and that glass can make or break you. The dog in the street pauses just as a car comes. Where does it stop? And now this, someone says. The precise line draws the bone that holds the cheek in place.

The music, a sack that carries the bones of those left alongside The trail of tears when we were forced To leave everything we knew by the way— I constructed an individual life in the so-called civilized world. We all did—far from the trees and plants Who had born us and fed us. All I wanted was the music, I would tell you now— Within it, what we cannot carry. I talk about then from a hotel room just miles From your home in the East Before you fled on your personal path of tears To the West, that worn-out American Dream Dogging your steps. You lived on a pedestal for me then, the driven diver who climbed Back up from the abyss, Venus on a seashell with a dagger In her hands. I had to look, and followed your tracks in the poems Cut by suffering. Aren’t they all? We’re in the apocalyptic age of addiction and forgetting. It’s worse now. But that dam, I had to tell you. I broke it open stone by stone. It took a saxophone, flowers, and your words Had something to do with it I can’t say exactly how. The trajectory wasn’t clean, even though it was sure. Does that make sense? Maybe it does only in the precincts of dreams and poetry, Not in a country lit twenty-four hours a day to keep dreams stuck Turning in a wheel In the houses of money. I read about transcendence, how the light Came in through the window of a nearby traveller And every cell of creation opened its mouth To drink grace. That’s what I never told you."}

I must’ve missed a lot since then. Now Christmas comes! The snow grows deep! I’m glad I didn’t oversleep. Sit close and give your bard a kiss, And tell me, dears, what did I miss? One thing I’m really hoping, dearies, Is that Cleveland won the Series. God love Bill Murray—was he there? And David Ross—how did he fare? Now that I’m clothed and on my feet, There’s tons of folks I’ve gotta greet. So for a start I’ll open with A big “Noel!” for Sula Smith, And send a storm of Yuletide glee To weatherperson Ginger Zee. I’ll carol odes of ancient stock For Prof. G. W. Bowersock And shout out, “Rest ye merry, Ma’am!” To plus-sized beauty Ashley Graham. Say, how’s Obama? How’s he been? And his fine family: joy to them! What’s Tommy Chong been doin’ lately? I hope Chris Pine is thriving greatly. May City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito Have a holiday that’s neat-o; Ditto to Winona Ryder, Elon Musk, and Gary Snyder, Joe Starita, of Nebraska, Faithful Reader, in Alaska, All midterm students cramming knowledge, And Pres. Greg Hess, of Wabash College. The mail is cluttering my stoop— I’ve really not been in the loop. I’ll read the piled-high papers when We get time to relax again. But first, I’ll strings of lights uncoil With my good buddy Brian Doyle ( The Brian Doyle, the Portland sage; His writing’s really all the rage) So we can tack these babies up, With help from quaffs of festive cup Which we shall share with Tamsin Venn And Esa-Pekka Salonen. I haven’t finished praising yet The splendid Lear deBessonet; I cannot find enough to say In praise of Lear deBessonet. And I am really half insane With how much I love LeBron James. (Glory be and me-oh-my-oh, What greatness cometh from Ohio!) Hey, look! From past the heliopause A sleigh approaches: Santa Claus! He swoops to do a flyby o’er Simone Biles, J. Safran Foer, And Mr. Dylan, Hibbing’s son. (Uh, what was that you said he’d won?) Then St. Nick flies an Immelmann Right over Michael Kimmelman, Edward Hirsch, Demi Lovato, Former wrestler Mr. Sato, Mark Rylance, Dita Von Teese, Monty Python’s great John Cleese, Olympic fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad, and George Cabot Lodge. Now Santa’s getting kind of crazy, Diving at Lenore Skenazy, Climate prescient James Hansen, Goth-y rocker Marilyn Manson, Joanne Liu, borderless doctor, Sly Stallone, and Robert Proctor. They hit the deck as he goes by And yell, “Who taught you how to fly?” What’s up with this verkakte year? What news do I not want to hear? With dark and gloomy-seeming frown You say I must be sitting down Before you’ll tell— Oh, no. Not that. Bring me a glass of something, stat. I gasp. I faint. I swoon. I sigh. AY-YI-YI-YI-YI-YI-YI-YI! (Printer: repeat for ten lines more While I lie face down on the floor.) <p class=\"has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading paywall\">Greetings, friends! It’s Christmastime, When once again we mangle rhyme And meter just to broadcast blessing, All good will and joy confessing, To those we like and those we don’t, The ones we’ll hug and those we won’t. Peace to us all. Thank God we’re here. A grand transcendence drawing near Reminds us to Love One Another: Everybody’s (gulp) our brother And sister, too—a saying true, Though easier to say than do. Look to the star, keep spirits high. Good times are coming by and by. Do not let yourselves get down; Faith’s more a verb than it’s a noun.<p class=\"has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading paywall\">Greetings, friends!

Tonight you’re lending Billy your car—it’s brand-new— and he’s a well-meaning, blue-eyed Byronic drinking man who last week, at 3 <em class=\"small\">A.M., stole your beached canoe, and when it sank he blamed it on a dolphin. A well-meaning, blue-eyed, Byronic, hard-drinking man whose phone calls you take, no matter the hour, who sank your canoe and blamed it on a dolphin, and the young man with him, whom the sea sadly devoured, so you’ll always take Billy’s call, no matter the hour. Because, you sigh, his mother’s dying, too, and he’s drinking again. He’s no longer a young man (he’s sad and he’s drowning), and neither are you, and all friends sometimes sin. Besides, you sigh, his mother’s dying, too, that’s why he’s drinking. She wasn’t a beauty—she came on to you long ago. And he’s not a young man; he’s drunk and he’s drowning. So you press the phone to your cheek, stare out the dark window. Who hasn’t come on to you? (Who wasn’t lovely long ago?) (Even Billy did; his tragic need, his blank blue eyes.) You press the phone to cheek, stare out the dark window, and listen to him make a mess of our peaceful lives. Now back in bed, we return to our disrupted romance.

I am resting in a socialistic Eden, beside long meadows, tall oaks for a king, sand paths that wander to sweet water, a ring of road that goes back to the ferry. This haze and heat might have me half asleep. The cherry globes bob slightly in the breeze. The shapes or shades of deer sprint round and leap through ancient lichened branches; toward the evening they loudly bell, a sound like awful grieving about the island’s groves and leas. 2 I am lying in a hammock in Sweden, I might have had a beer or two—beer made just down the road from here, and brewed to sweeten such summer days and free this people from their goodness, their incorruptible aplomb, for a few hours dreamily swayed. The label says one Anders Kotz brewed it. May he do well. He’s lifted me on waves that lift the island also. Feet to the bowsprit, I’m launched on Lake Malar and headed north. Frost giants might say what’s up with the earth, if I can find them in their icy caves. 3 The world’s on fire this summer: rub two sticks and miles of forestland will turn to smoke; the ocean’s thermostat went up some clicks and fish are none too pleased; rain, if rain falls, runs off the car parks, courts, and malls— the worms ask us is this a joke. And all the while three brothers in the night, three corners of the continent, we sigh, we shout, we argue from the left to right. Frost giants loose the ice caps from their grip in the background. And so my crazy trip up to the north to ask them why. 4 Or am I just asleep? Is this a winding sheet? My almost cosmic snoring joins the storms that rough up trees and flatten fields of wheat.

I am resting in a socialistic Eden, beside long meadows, tall oaks for a king, sand paths that wander to sweet water, a ring of road that goes back to the ferry. This haze and heat might have me half asleep. The cherry globes bob slightly in the breeze. The shapes or shades of deer sprint round and leap through ancient lichened branches; toward the evening they loudly bell, a sound like awful grieving about the island’s groves and leas. 2 I am lying in a hammock in Sweden, I might have had a beer or two—beer made just down the road from here, and brewed to sweeten such summer days and free this people from their goodness, their incorruptible aplomb, for a few hours dreamily swayed. The label says one Anders Kotz brewed it. May he do well. He’s lifted me on waves that lift the island also. Feet to the bowsprit, I’m launched on Lake Malar and headed north. Frost giants might say what’s up with the earth, if I can find them in their icy caves. 3 The world’s on fire this summer: rub two sticks and miles of forestland will turn to smoke; the ocean’s thermostat went up some clicks and fish are none too pleased; rain, if rain falls, runs off the car parks, courts, and malls— the worms ask us is this a joke. And all the while three brothers in the night, three corners of the continent, we sigh, we shout, we argue from the left to right. Frost giants loose the ice caps from their grip in the background. And so my crazy trip up to the north to ask them why. 4 Or am I just asleep? Is this a winding sheet? My almost cosmic snoring joins the storms that rough up trees and flatten fields of wheat. Great currents draw back, mustering their forces. Out on the lake, waves massing like warhorses. The hills unfold in flaming forms. And the wolves run. Is this how the world ends?

I’d been hired to lead the family from danger to a territory full of more seeds than bullets, but, truth was, in the darkness there was no telling what was rooting in the soil. Plots of complete silence, romantics posing in a field bludgeoned by shame. The heart, biologically speaking, is ugly as it pumps its passion and fear down the veins. Which is to say, starting out we have no wounds to speak of beyond the ways our parents expressed their love. We were never sure what the pig was after or whether it was, in fact, not a pig but some single-minded soul despair turned into a pig, some devil worthy of mercy. Without giving away the enigmatic ending, I will say, when we swallowed the flesh, our eyes were closed."}

I play stickball after school in the lot Behind the laundry. I come home bruised From fistfights and snowball fights With boys who live in the tenement on the corner. Not once do I play with the boy I am In this life, whose father, too old for the draft, Starts a paint company in a rented basement Which almost goes under after a year And then is saved, as the war continues, By a steady flow of government contracts That allows my mother to retire from nursing And devote herself to work with the poor. I find our quiet neighborhood of handsome houses And shady streets crushingly uneventful. No surprise I spend hours each day turning the pages Of stories about trolls, wizards, giants, Wandering knights, and captive princesses. In my other life, I have to leave high school To bolster the family income as lab boy In the building attached to the factory that in this life My father owns.

If I don’t answer the bell On weekends in summer, I’m in the garden, Strolling the shady path beneath the maples, Musing on the difference between a life Deficient in incident and a life uncluttered. Seated at my patio table, I write a letter Asking a friend what book has he read In the last few months that has opened his eyes On a subject that’s likely to interest me. Meanwhile, across the street, in the garden Of my other life, I can often be found Hoeing the rutabaga and beans and cabbage That I plan to share with neighbors in the hope of planting The seeds of communal feelings more hardy Than any known to sprout here before. It won’t be long till I knock at the door of the house Where in this life I’m at my desk preparing a class On solitude in the novels of the Romantics. Do I say to myself it’s one more stranger Eager to sell me something or make a convert, Or do I go down to see who’s there?In my other life the B-17 my father is piloting Is shot down over Normandy And my mother raises her sons alone On her widow’s pension and on what she earns As a nurse at the local hospital, a sum That pays for a third-floor walkup In a neighborhood that’s seen better days. I play stickball after school in the lot Behind the laundry. I come home bruised From fistfights and snowball fights With boys who live in the tenement on the corner. Not once do I play with the boy I am In this life, whose father, too old for the draft, Starts a paint company in a rented basement Which almost goes under after a year And then is saved, as the war continues, By a steady flow of government contracts That allows my mother to retire from nursing And devote herself to work with the poor. I find our quiet neighborhood of handsome houses And shady streets crushingly uneventful. No surprise I spend hours each day turning the pages Of stories about trolls, wizards, giants, Wandering knights, and captive princesses.

But wait, white can’t know what white feels. Where’s the life in that? Where’s the right in that? Where’s the white in that? At the bone of bone white breathes the fear of seeing, the frustration of being unequal to white. White-male portraits on white walls were intended to mean ownership of all, the privilege of all, even as white walls white in. And this is understandable, yes, understandable because the culture claims white owns everything—the wealth of no one anyone knows. Still the equation holds— jobs and health and schools and better than before and different from now and enough and always and eventually mine. This is what it means to wear a color and believe the embrace of its touch. What white long expected was to work its way into an upwardly mobile fit. In the old days white included a life, even without luck or chance of birth. The scaffolding had rungs and legacy and the myth of meritocracy fixed in white. Now white can’t hold itself distant from the day’s touch— even as the touch holds so little white would own— foreclosure vanished pensions school systems in disrepair free trade rising unemployment unpaid medical bills school debt car debt debt debt. White is living its brick-and-mortar loss, staving off more loss, exhaustion, aggrieved exposure, a pale heart even as in daylight white hardens its features. Eyes, which hold all the light, harden. Jaws, which close down on nothing, harden. Hands, which assembled, and packaged, and built, harden into a fury that cannot call power to account though it’s not untrue jobs were outsourced and it’s not untrue an economic base was cut out from under. It’s not untrue. If people could just come clean about their pain, the being at a loss when just being white is not working. Who said there is no hierarchy inside white walls? Who implied white owns everything even as it owns nothing? But white can’t strike its own structure. White can’t oust its own system. All the loss is nothing next to any other who can be thrown out. In daylight this right to righteous rage doubles down the supremacy of white in this way.At the bone of bone white breathes the fear of seeing, the frustration of being unequal to white.

They seemed like glamorous friends, distant but always there. I’d seen one only once during the day.

{"url": "https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/23/tissue-gallery", "poetry": " On the fifth floor of the medical school, sequestered from public view, a black slab lab table lined with old apothecary jars and twist-top jars sealed with paraffin wax, a shoal of not-fish treading bronzy water, each homunculus labelled in terms of in-utero days and weeks. In this jarscape, a palm-size one sitting with legs crossed, arms raised protectively, clasping the top of his head like a child expecting blows in a parental brawl, and this golem, a perfect mini-person, holds fingers curved lightly in front of him, as if playing a piano chord, and this quelque chose has blackened soles— in the womb, a douen meant to range the barefoot forest, those faceless stillborn and early-dead children with backward feet, who lure human playmates to the woods and fill their always hungry mouths with little crabs. All casualties are clipped with yellowed plastic navel clamps that look like bones. Here are twins, one larger than the other, one malformed with hydrocephalitic-fissured face, and this one’s wrinkly forehead, the face of a worried eighty-year-old concentrating on his death, an extra epaulette flap on his shoulder, as if he is sprouting wings; triplets like three piglets, one with lots of hair, one with cauliflower, puckered ear, one with a purple-black hand reaching out of the water, as if in hope to be rescued from drowning. The thirty-six-weekers are not stored in glassware. A perfect pair, girl and boy, are on separate cookie baking sheets, wrapped in sterile pads, their swaddling blankets. They are not desiccated, withered, mummified, quick-frozen, frost-nipped, or sealed in wax. They look like leatherette dolls in mid-kick stop-motion animation, as if they’d only now stopped breathing. Girl was a low birth weight, vagina snapped as tightly shut as the seam of a walnut. Boy is not the color of life, a rich-colored brown boy bleached out to plasticine-pale, dun-white. Still, on his cheek-ear-hair, the almost-feel of life. The abdomen is caved in, and the testicles are paper-thin, black, crumpled leaves. Some in the jars were named and tagged on the wrist. I was told that I cannot tell you the names. It is a secret between the women and these medical anomalies. One is named for a hurricane. The restos muertos have closed eyes and African features. They were not colorfast, so the chemicals have bleached them to albino. The women, who came with gravid uterus to Puerto Rico from the Virgin Islands, seeking to save or end pregnancies, do not know that these small ones are still here curled in their womb poses, each blanched in its lit-glass aquarium, lolling in solvent tinted the color of beer, brandy, honey, oil, or perfume. These small floating gods in primer paint, never to be besprinkled with blessed water to help them cross over, never to evaporate, dust-scatter, or waste—they are here and not here! What is the shelf-life of the unborn? In the Caribbean, women must travel from island to island to get needed health care, and so these doodads were not carried home but donated, no one knows how long ago. I have been invited here by a doctor who loves the arts, and whom I like. I was told beforehand only that I would be viewing human tissue. He proposes collaboration, an artistic public exhibition of these impossible children, who will never utter “peacock,” “butterfly,” “confetti,” “crazy quilt,” “cashmere,” or “soap.” Skullduggery. Monster Midway. Gaff joints. Shell games. Sideshow piebald children. Human oddities and the science of teratology. At home, I whisper to the midnight page, Women of the Virgin Islands, Sistren , I saw them, and they are okay. Your small ones are still on the Earth!Recording courtesy of Radio Universidad de Puerto Rico WRTU-FM On the fifth floor of the medical school, sequestered from public view, a black slab lab table lined with old apothecary jars and twist-top jars sealed with paraffin wax, a shoal of not-fish treading bronzy water, each homunculus labelled in terms of in-utero days and weeks. In this jarscape, a palm-size one sitting with legs crossed, arms raised protectively, clasping the top of his head like a child expecting blows in a parental brawl, and this golem, a perfect mini-person, holds fingers curved lightly in front of him, as if playing a piano chord, and this quelque chose has blackened soles— in the womb, a douen meant to range the barefoot forest, those faceless stillborn and early-dead children with backward feet, who lure human playmates to the woods and fill their always hungry mouths with little crabs. All casualties are clipped with yellowed plastic navel clamps that look like bones. Here are twins, one larger than the other, one malformed with hydrocephalitic-fissured face, and this one’s wrinkly forehead, the face of a worried eighty-year-old concentrating on his death, an extra epaulette flap on his shoulder, as if he is sprouting wings; triplets like three piglets, one with lots of hair, one with cauliflower, puckered ear, one with a purple-black hand reaching out of the water, as if in hope to be rescued from drowning. The thirty-six-weekers are not stored in glassware. A perfect pair, girl and boy, are on separate cookie baking sheets, wrapped in sterile pads, their swaddling blankets. They are not desiccated, withered, mummified, quick-frozen, frost-nipped, or sealed in wax. They look like leatherette dolls in mid-kick stop-motion animation, as if they’d only now stopped breathing. Girl was a low birth weight, vagina snapped as tightly shut as the seam of a walnut. Boy is not the color of life, a rich-colored brown boy bleached out to plasticine-pale, dun-white. Still, on his cheek-ear-hair, the almost-feel of life. The abdomen is caved in, and the testicles are paper-thin, black, crumpled leaves. Some in the jars were named and tagged on the wrist. I was told that I cannot tell you the names. It is a secret between the women and these medical anomalies. One is named for a hurricane. The restos muertos have closed eyes and African features. They were not colorfast, so the chemicals have bleached them to albino. The women, who came with gravid uterus to Puerto Rico from the Virgin Islands, seeking to save or end pregnancies, do not know that these small ones are still here curled in their womb poses, each blanched in its lit-glass aquarium, lolling in solvent tinted the color of beer, brandy, honey, oil, or perfume. These small floating gods in primer paint, never to be besprinkled with blessed water to help them cross over, never to evaporate, dust-scatter, or waste—they are here and not here! What is the shelf-life of the unborn? In the Caribbean, women must travel from island to island to get needed health care, and so these doodads were not carried home but donated, no one knows how long ago. I have been invited here by a doctor who loves the arts, and whom I like. I was told beforehand only that I would be viewing human tissue. He proposes collaboration, an artistic public exhibition of these impossible children, who will never utter “peacock,” “butterfly,” “confetti,” “crazy quilt,” “cashmere,” or “soap.” Skullduggery. Monster Midway. Gaff joints. Shell games. Sideshow piebald children. Human oddities and the science of teratology. At home, I whisper to the midnight page, Women of the Virgin Islands, Sistren , I saw them, and they are okay. Your small ones are still on the Earth!"}

This hardy Duranta attracts hummingbirds and butterflies. May it thrive, and sew itself in as the soil dries. Between Victoria and Lavaca, in my mind’s eye I saw a thousand Comanche in cumulonimbi racing thirty hundred stolen horses over the prairie to the sea. When the sorghum field, that tapestry, was little more than “Chocolate Swale” (a sign stuck in the silt, née swamp), official history passed the bolus of guilt back and forth, from the Comanche, who kept back captives, to the Texans, who (in what may have been an interpretive blunder) slaughtered the chiefs, back to the Comanche, who torched their captives in revenge and went on “an orgy of horse-thieving.” While at night Comanche jump on Texas with a thump, the dream of one Buffalo Hump results in enough calico and ribbon to get lost in (as I sew myself into this clay) riding back to Austin. Too late. Juliet Constance managed to get her hem wet but they seized her and stripped her down to the whalebone corset —flummoxed. While the townspeople watched from dinghies offshore, on that hand-over-hand surf, helpless, they later swore her whalebone corset wouldn’t budge. They saw the town burning, the warehouses looted; and in the smoke’s going and returning, Comanche donning the top hats and pigeon-tailed coats. Adorned with all the brass buttons a merchant ship could float, and twirling their parasols and festooning each his horse with ribbon, the Comanche rode off. In the cumulonimbus of their dust, they took our bibelot Juliet. Buffalo Hump, meet Whalebone Corset! For a gold watch her young husband perished. El Dorado: where there’s pyrite in the piranha, gilt in the sweet potato. Gold in the sorghum tassels, gold in the sargassum weed strewing the shore where they put Juliet on a stolen steed. Gold when wet, that is; rust-brown when dry; furring the coast, drying at different rates in the sun, so gold and rust co-roast. It seemed a herd of buffalo was barbered by some god at first.

The deep-blue, upended frisbee looks like nothing less than a saucer of primal soup from Genesis, the first meal of the first day. By the seventh all Creation and we were invited to the feast of ourselves, into perpetuity. She was saved a second time, that Juliet, when a crop of arrows foundered on her whalebone corset. Saved, then, with nothing more than a sunburn. And still nothing more than a stone commemorating Linnville between new tract housing and the littoral.

So let this road take you, autumn’s enchanted boy lifted into the wet-yellow lamps of the maples; taken up by that fleeting light, let your trophies fall to the rain, let the lean of the motorbike carry you down the moraine, across the rising chill from the fields, on into town: warm light, voices, a meal in the tavern’s golden cave. You won’t be riding that other road much again, but this one: the kind man’s dark leather back in front of you, the cycle’s center of gravity sinking lower, the delicious clay-cold of the field between here and home rising up, scent of hay, of animals and ruin. He knows you would just as soon stay, but lucky he’s not here for that. He ferries you home, maybe every night of your life. Or that’s what you wish he could do, though you know it’s you leaning against him that makes your mutual direction. Every night a little like the one he came home late, happy, from the leather bar, and you in your welling up out of sleep said, I have a lake in me, and he looked at you closely, with a generous, unflinching scrutiny, undeceived, loving, as clear a gaze as anyone had ever brought to you, and he said, You do.November and this road’s tunnel of soft fire draws you forward, as it descends, as if you were moving toward— radical completion, some encompassment?

This is a visionary moment in the history of time, incomplete without angels, without at least Argente of the tarnished wings, or the mangled half-assed Incondante who speaks only in riddles, or one-winged Sylvania who glows in the dark. All off in eternity doing their sacred numbers. Instead at 6:43 <em class=\"small\">a.m . we have Vartan Baghosian with a face seamed like a softball and Minky Schantz who pitched three games for the Toledo Mud Hens in ’39 and lost them all, we have the Volpe sisters who married the attic on Brush Street and won’t come down, we have me, fresh as last week, bitching about my back, my bad ankle, we have psoriasis, heartburn, the four-day hangover, prostatitis, Jewish mothers, Catholic guilt, we have the teen-age Woodward Ave. whores going to bed alone at last, hugging no one for that long moment before the young Madonnas rise from separate beds to open their shutters on whatever the day presents, to pledge their virtue and their twitching, incomparable bodies to Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Tupperware. All this in rooms where even in the gray dishwater dawn the chrome grill on an Admiral black-and-white TV gleams like the chalice of Abraham. And from his corner the genius of this time and place, Uncle Nate, chomping his first White Owl of the day, calls out for a doughnut and sweetened milky coffee to dunk it in and laces up his high-tops and swears by the vision of his blind right eye he will have strange young pussy before the sun sets on his miserable balding dome. Today we shall paint, for Nate is a true artist trained in the eight-hour day to master the necessary and not the strung-out martyrs of El Greco or the brooding landscapes of an awful century. No, today we paint the walls, the lintels, the ceilings, the dadoes, and the doodads of Mrs. Victoria Settle formerly of Lake Park, Illinois, now come to grace our city with the myth of her late husband, her terriers, her fake accent, her Victorian brooches, her perfect posture, and especially her money.

So savor the hours as Nate recounts the day he hitchhiked to Toledo only to arrive too late to see the young Dempsey flatten Willard and claim the lily-white championship of the world. “Story of my life,” says Nate, “the last to arrive, the first to leave.” Not even Aesop could outdo our Nate, our fabulist, whose name even is pure invention, a confabulation of his prison reading and his twelve-year formal education in the hobo camps of his long boyhood.

In the pool, I was more heavy than light. Pockmarked and flabby in a floppy hat. What will my body be when parked all night in the earth? Midsummer. Breathe in. Breathe out. I am not on the oxygen tank. Twice a week we have sex. The lithe girls poolside I see them at their weddings I see them with babies their hips thickening I see them middle-aged.

I like to feel the work I am exerting being changed, the weight of my person refigured, and I like to hang above the ground, thus; hammocks, snorkeling, alcohol. I also like the mind to feel a kind of neutral buoyancy and to that end I set aside a day a week, Shabbat, to not act. Having ceded independence to the sunset I will not be shaving, illuminating rooms, or raising the temperature of food. If occasionally I like to feel the leavening of being near a much larger unnatural tension, I walk off a Sunday through the high fields of blanket bog, saxifrage, a few thin Belted Galloways, rounding Lough Mallon to stand by the form of beauty upheld in a scrubby acre at Creggandevsky, where I do duck and enter under a capstone mapped by rival empires of yellow feather-moss and powdery white lichen. I like then to stop, crouched, and press my back on a housing of actual rock, coldness which lives for a while on the skin. And I like when I give you the nightfeed, Harvey, how you’re really concentrating on it: fists clenched, eyes shut, like this is bliss. I like a steady disruption. I like it when the solid mantle turns to shingle and water rushes up it over and over, in love. My white-noise machine from Argos is set to Crashing Wave but I’m not averse to the presence of numerous and minute quanta moving very fast in unison; occasions when a light wind undulates the ears of wheat, or a hessian sack of pearl- barley seed is sliced with a pocket knife and pours. I like the way it sounds pattering on stone. I like how the starlings over Monti cohere and separate their bodies into one cyclonic symphony, and I like that the hawk of the mind catches at their purse, pulse, caul, arc. I like the excitation passing as a shadow-ripple back and how the bag is snatched, rolls slack; straight, falciform; mouthing; bulbing; a pumping heart. I like to interface with millions of colored pixels depicting attractive people procreating on a screen itself dependent on rare metals mined by mud-gray children who trudge up bamboo scaffolding above a grayish-red lake of belching mud. I like how the furnace burning earth instills in me reflexive gestures of timidity and self-pity and deference as I walk along the kinder surfaces, grass, say, or sand, unable ever to meet with my eyes the gaze of the sun. I can imagine that my first and fifth marriages will be to the same human, a woman, the first marriage working well enough that we decide to try again as soon as it’s, you know, mutually convenient. I can see that. I like the fact that we’re “supercooled star matter,” even if I can’t envisage you as anything other than warm and bleating. The thing is I can be persuaded fairly easily to initiate immune responses by the fake safety signals of national anthems, cleavage, family photographs, country lanes, large-eyed mammals, fireworks, the King James Bible, Nina Simone singing “The Twelfth of Never,” cave paintings, coffins, dolphins, dolmens. But I like it also when the fat impasto of the canvas gets slashed by a tourist with a claw hammer, and a glimpse is caught of what you couldn’t say. Entanglement I like, spooky action at a distance analogizing some little thing including this long glance across the escalators or how you know the song before you switch the station on. When a photon of light meets a half-silvered mirror and splits one meets the superposition of two, being twinned: and this repeats. Tickling your back, Katherine, to get you to sleep, I like to lie here with my eyes closed and think of my schoolfriends’ houses, before choosing one to walk through slowly, room by sunlit room.To deal with all the sensational loss I like to interface with Earth.

And he doesn’t mind the smell of stale beer or the damp cold that seeps through his jacket and stiffens his already stiff hands. He’s spent weeks lying on his bed in the board and care waiting for this moment when Zenyatta, the mare who never lost a race, called in the Times “the coolest horse in the world,” goes for twenty out of twenty. So the only question is who to place, who to show, to make a trifecta that will bring back the days when he skipped out on grinding afternoons at the dry cleaner’s, sweating at the mangle, saturated with solvent fumes, as he bagged woollen coats and linen dresses and the jockeys’ silks— gleaming pinks, buttercup yellows, and aquamarines. When they picked up their colors, they slipped him tips on who was hot, and he’d escape to the track at Aqueduct to see those myths of muscle, flanks quivering, flashing their tails. And now and then he’d score, gather up the family and head to Chinatown for lobster and black-bean sauce. Once he even took them to Lancaster to see the Amish in their buggies, their aprons and little white hats. But you could write the story of all the paychecks fed like hay to the horses. And he’ll lose this one, too. In the final stretch, Blame, a homebred chestnut colt in the lead. Mike Smith up on Zenyatta closing hard, going to the whip"}

They held each other, rocked back and forth, and I thought Jesus Christ, am I guilty again of one of those small errors I’ve repeated until it became large? What about me? I thought. What about the sadness of being stupid? Why doesn’t her husband return with maybe a beer and a knowing nod?"}

He synchronized Christ With deep time, a paleontologist turned priest. He taught the Inuit not to shiver or shout When they enunciated pure Canadian: They traded their own pelts for the cool E.S.L. He flew to Seoul, to the reggae gymnasium, To the icebreaker mojito outing, To twin Filipinas with my features. I stood sentry and watched my own reëntry, Expecting a theft, never expecting To witness myself absconded when I absconded, Both looter and loot, at night, on foot . . .

I’ll call him John, although he was never a John or even a Juan or a Jack, although his surname— Moradian—ended with “i-a-n,” which is Ian in Scotland, the Gaelic version of John. Our John, John Moradian, gone sixty-seven years ago from our schoolboy class into the wider world of war where his one-way ticket got punched. I would start this again if I could, start quietly with a Dougie or an Alan, both of whom made it into their thirties, though neither ever spoke of the past being anything but over with. What they actually thought I’ll never know. One spring day the whole class went by bus to the foundry at Ford Rouge to see earth melted and poured like syrup into fire. “Look up,” someone said, maybe Dougie or Alan, so I did, and saw way up above the collisions of metal and men a family of sparrows in the trapped light, trapped themselves, or perhaps out to reclaim their lost space. Speaking of perhaps, perhaps I’m dawdling because I haven’t seen John or Alan or Dougie in over fifty years. Perhaps I just like repeating their names as though that could help them or perhaps help me, and it does, it helps me. They’re beyond my help. Later the class picnicked on egg salad beside a wide stream that fed our filthy river. Alan, or maybe it was Dougie, managed to cross the water leaping from rock to rock and then back again, his balance was that good. Alan, or maybe Dougie, whoever had crossed, dared me to try, but I knew enough even then not to. I remember the sky darkening in the east, the bus arriving with the rain, the windows steaming up to hide the flooded streets. I remember I sat next to Alan who lied a blue streak about an older girl who owned her own car. The bus driver lost the way and had to stop at a filling station in Delray to get directions, so the trip was endless. I got back before nightfall, but the day kept going on and on into the future.I’ll call him John, although he was never a John or even a Juan or a Jack, although his surname— Moradian—ended with “i-a-n,” which is Ian in Scotland, the Gaelic version of John.

Everything inside is. Cyndi Lauper and I both fall into pure emptiness. That’s one way to think: I think I am right now. We have no past we won’t reach back— The clock ticks like the nails of a foiled dog chasing a faster rabbit across a glass expanse. A wheel of fortune spins on its side, stops and starts. The stopped time is no longer time, only an illusion that says, I can have this, and this, and this. Cyndi says nothing works like that. There is no all-purpose plastic totem that acts like a bouncer holding back the fact that at least once a day you look up: it’s the self you kept in a suitcase holding the key, coming to meet you, every cell a node in a network of ongoing doubling. Cyndi says the world expands but always keeps us in it. For every you, there’s a riot grrrl in prison in Putin’s Russia. You know the self dissolves and when it does—no figure, all ground, like a surface seen microscopically— you fill the frame and explode, a rubber-wound inside unravelling and becoming a measurement of whatever exits. It’s like sleep, if sleep were a film that didn’t include you, but no, whatever is happening, you are always in it, the indispensable point of view. Proof of that is that a lift force brings you back and you wake, back to your face, hands, mirror image in the bed next to you, Ketamine moment where kinesthesia is secondary to everything is possible: you and you and you and now and you and yes and you with the night-self singing backup.

Julia, hands flaring, in the clunky music Of a pound of real gold charms, Walter in a tan linen jacket And shoes soft as old money. Sweet-tempered, sweet-tongued, He’d tease the women to blushing, And let his wife reign queen In a diamond ring to knock your eyes out. She was known from New York to L. A. For her fried chicken and greens, And didn’t hesitate, after hours of driving, To throw an apron over a French cotton dress And slap the flour on thirty or more pieces. Oh, the chicken breasts and thighs Spattering, juicy, in just the right degree of heat, As she told stories, hilarious and true, To a kitchen full of steamy women That made them double over and pee themselves. Saturday morning, men to golf, And women in floral robes With cups of a New Orleans blend So strong they said It stained the rim and turned you black; Me, in a high chair, straining For language, my bottle Stirred with a spoon of coffee And half a pint of cream. At fifteen, My first trip cross-country on a train, I stopped to spend the night. We took the El to Marshall Field’s, Where Julia bought my first expensive cold creams And hose the shades of which—for the first time— Dared the colors of our colored skin. She told me she had lovers, One a handsome Pullman porter.

She was known from New York to L. A. For her fried chicken and greens, And didn’t hesitate, after hours of driving, To throw an apron over a French cotton dress And slap the flour on thirty or more pieces. Oh, the chicken breasts and thighs Spattering, juicy, in just the right degree of heat, As she told stories, hilarious and true, To a kitchen full of steamy women That made them double over and pee themselves. Saturday morning, men to golf, And women in floral robes With cups of a New Orleans blend So strong they said It stained the rim and turned you black; Me, in a high chair, straining For language, my bottle Stirred with a spoon of coffee And half a pint of cream. At fifteen, My first trip cross-country on a train, I stopped to spend the night. We took the El to Marshall Field’s, Where Julia bought my first expensive cold creams And hose the shades of which—for the first time— Dared the colors of our colored skin. She told me she had lovers, One a handsome Pullman porter.

They stopped in front of the palace, and all around them echoed the sound of the lyre; it was Phemius striking the chords of the prelude as he began his song.

One building leads into the next, and the courtyard is very well built, with its corniced wall, and the double doors are so solid that no enemy could break through. A crowd must be feasting inside now. I can smell the roast meat, and I hear the lyre, which the gods have made the crown of a banquet.” Then, in response to his words, Eumaeus, you said, “It is easy for someone as clever as you to notice that kind of thing. But now we need to consider what we should do. Either you enter the palace first and approach the suitors, and I will stay here, or you stay here if you wish, and I will go first. But don’t be too long; someone may see you waiting and throw a stone or a spear at you. Please be careful.” Odysseus said to him, “All right. I understand. You go in first, and I will remain behind. I am accustomed to being beaten and having things thrown at me. My heart has endured. Before now I have suffered great hardships, both on the sea and in war, and if I must suffer another hardship so be it. But a man can’t hide the belly’s accursèd craving, which causes so many evils and makes us sail ships across the vast sea to bring war upon distant people.” As they spoke, a dog who was lying there lifted his head and pricked up his ears. It was Argos, Odysseus’ dog; he had trained him and brought him up as a puppy, but never hunted with him before he sailed off to Troy. In earlier times the young men had taken him out with them to hunt for wild goats and deer and hares, but he had grown old in his master’s absence, and now he lay abandoned on one of the heaps of mule and cattle dung that piled up outside the front gates until the farmhands could come by and cart it off to manure the fields. And so the dog Argos lay there, covered with ticks. As soon as he was aware of Odysseus, he wagged his tail and flattened his ears, but he lacked the strength to get up and go to his master. Odysseus wiped a tear away, turning aside to keep the swineherd from seeing it, and he said, “Eumaeus, it is surprising that such a dog, of such quality, should be lying here on a dunghill. He is a beauty, but I can’t tell if his looks were matched by his speed or if he was one of those pampered table dogs, which are kept around just for show.” Then, in response to his words, Eumaeus, you said, “This is the dog of a man who died far away. If he were now what he used to be when Odysseus left and sailed off to Troy, you would be astonished at his power and speed. No animal could escape him in the deep forest once he began to track it. What an amazing nose he had! But misfortune has fallen upon him now that his master is dead in some far-distant land, and the women are all too thoughtless to take any care of him. Servants are always like that: when their masters aren’t right there to give them their orders, they slack off, get lazy, and no longer do an honest day’s work, for Zeus almighty takes half the good out of a man on the day he becomes a slave.” With these words he entered the palace and went to the hall where the suitors were assembled at one of their banquets.

It was a bright cold starry night on Lake Chippewa. Lake Chippewa was a “living” lake then, though soon afterward it would choke and die. In the bright cold morning after we could spy them only through a patch of ice brushed clear of snow. Scarcely three feet below, they were oblivious of us. Together beneath the ice in each other’s arms. Jean-Marie’s head rested on Troy’s shoulder. Their hair had floated up and was frozen. Their eyes were open in the perfect lucidity of death. Calmly they sat upright. Not a breath! It was 1967, there were no seat belts to keep them apart. Beautiful as mannequins in Slater Brothers’ window. Faces flawless, not a blemish. Yet—you could believe they might be breath- ing, for some trick of scintillate light revealed tiny bubbles in the ice, and a motion like a smile in Jean-Marie’s perfect face. How far Troy’d driven the car onto Lake Chippewa before the ice creaked, and cracked, and opened like the parting of giant jaws—at least fifty feet! This was a feat like his 7-foot-3.8-inch high jump. In the briny snow you could see the car tracks along the shore where in summer sand we’d sprawl and soak up sun in defiance of skin carcinomas to come. And you could see how deftly he’d turned the wheel onto the ice at just the right place. And on the ice you could see how he’d made the tires spin and grab and Jean-Marie clutching his hand Oh oh oh! Eastern edge of Lake Chippewa, shallower than most of the lake but deep enough at twelve feet to suck down Mr. Dupuy’s Chevy so all that was visible from shore was the gaping ice wound. And then in the starry night a drop to -5 degrees Fahrenheit and ice freezing over the sunken car. Who would have guessed it, of Lake Chippewa! Now in the morning through the swept ice there’s a shocking intimacy just below. With our mittens we brush away powder snow. With our boots we kick away ice chunks. Lie flat and stare through the ice Seeing Jean-Marie Schuter and Troy Dupuy as we’d never seen them in life. Our breaths steam in Sunday-morning light. It will be something we must live with— the couple do not care about our astonishment. Perfect in love, and needing no one to applaud as they’d been oblivious of our applause at the Herkimer Junior High prom where they were crowned Queen and King three years before. (In Herkimer County, New York, you grew up fast. The body matured, the brain lagged behind, like the slowest runner on the track team we’d applaud with affection mistaken for teen mockery.) No one wanted to summon help just yet. It was a dreamy silence above ice as below. And the ice a shifting hue—silvery, ghost-gray, pale blue—as the sky shifts overhead like a frowning parent. What! Lake Chippewa was where some of us went ice-fishing with our grandfathers. Sometimes, we skated. Summers there were speedboats, canoes. There’d been drownings in Lake Chippewa we’d heard but no one of ours . Police, fire-truck, ambulance sirens would rend the air. Strangers would shout at one another. We’d be ordered back—off the ice of Lake Chippewa that shone with beauty and onto the littered shore. By harsh daylight made to see Mr. Dupuy’s 1963 Chevy hooked like a great doomed fish. All that privacy yanked upward pitiless and streaming icy rivulets! We knew it was wrong to disturb the frozen lovers and make of them mere bodies. Sweet-lethal embrace of Lake Chippewa But no embrace can survive thawing. One of us, Gordy Garrison, would write a song, “Too Young to Marry But Not Too Young to Die” (echo of Bill Monroe’s “I Traced Her Little Footprints in the Snow”), which he’d sing with his band the Raiders, accompanying himself on the Little Martin guitar he’d bought from his cousin Art Garrison when Art enlisted in the U.S. Navy and for a while it was all you’d hear at Herkimer High, where the Raiders played for Friday-night dances in the gym, but then we graduated and things changed and nothing more came of Gordy’s song or of the Raiders. <em class=\"small\">“TOO YOUNG TO MARRY BUT NOT TOO YOUNG TO DIE” was the headline in the Herkimer Packet .

The clipping is yellowed, deeply creased, and beginning to tear. When some of us stare at the photos our hearts cease beating—oh, just a beat!

We have a place three floors up with a view of Paddington Recreation Ground, which, now the snow is gone, is under the plow entirely. Renewal or revival, who can tell? From the windows, after storms, what we see, surrounded by the city, is a park turned into empty and emptier country, acres of scabby mud thawing in weak sunlight, then in the longer rains, something like a potter’s field awash in potsherds. So one Sunday, ankle deep, we go wading, picking among the scatter of what has been a landfill for eighteenth- and nineteenth-century cracked or flawed Wedgwood—serving bowls and cups, tureens and dinner plates with scenes of rural life, bric-a-brac perhaps, and lavish urnlike shapes meant for death or human waste, festooned with flowers and bunch-of-grapes and the full and tender leaves of Arcadia, now broken down to broken bones and carried in house buckets to a bath in order to be picked among again, like the piece I have in hand. Years later, I’m standing at the grave of Keats, wondering what to steal, token Keatsiana, when the god of the discarded builds for me a mountain, a mound of Roman potsherds named Monte Testaccio, here within the meadows of lovers and dead poets, Cimitero Acattolico, just inside the city of the old Aurelian Wall— Shelley, Shelley’s son, Severn and Trelawney, and the four thousand others among the weeds and grasses, cypresses and pines.

When I was small, closer to the ground, I’d see things no one else could see, which may be why my father made me follow him down foundry garden rows of digging, pulling, picking, waste not, want not, though what I’d find among potato vines and corn was coins and Shawnee arrowheads and ingots into stones and flints and rusted cartridges— and coral-colored shells shattered into seeds, as if a sea, upon a time, had planted them.We have a place three floors up with a view of Paddington Recreation Ground, which, now the snow is gone, is under the plow entirely.

Sure. That said, your body has a few ideas so bright that we might meet some night and render a dark room light as the last day before the world ends, that doom that was supposed to dawn today, but by now, hours worn on and in, we know there’s no such luxury as fine as that finality for now. For now, at least, I’ll have to kiss apocalypse goodbye, resign myself to this more mundane pain, the solace of the solstice, year’s earliest sunset and its longest night. I try to catch that fade of color with, without a flash. Both tries prove terrible. The horizon smudges up against the sky’s blur like a child’s heavy-handed landscape and inept erasure.

It came to me one night as I was falling asleep that I had finished with those amorous adventures to which I had long been a slave. Finished with love? my heart murmured. To which I responded that many profound discoveries awaited us, hoping, at the same time, I would not be asked to name them. For I could not name them. But the belief that they existed— surely this counted for something? 2. The next night brought the same thought, this time concerning poetry, and in the nights that followed various other passions and sensations were, in the same way, set aside forever, and each night my heart protested its future, like a small child being deprived of a favorite toy. But these farewells, I said, are the way of things. And once more I alluded to the vast territory opening to us with each valediction. And with that phrase I became a glorious knight riding into the setting sun, and my heart became the steed underneath me. 3. I was, you will understand, entering the kingdom of death, though why this landscape was so conventional I could not say. Here, too, the days were very long while the years were very short. The sun sank over the far mountain. The stars shone, the moon waxed and waned. Soon faces from the past appeared to me: my mother and father, my infant sister; they had not, it seemed, finished what they had to say, though now I could hear them because my heart was still. 4. At this point, I attained the precipice but the trail did not, I saw, descend on the other side; rather, having flattened out, it continued at this altitude as far as the eye could see, though gradually the mountain that supported it completely dissolved so that I found myself riding steadily through the air— All around, the dead were cheering me on, the joy of finding them obliterated by the task of responding to them— 5. As we had all been flesh together, now we were mist. As we had been before objects with shadows, now we were substance without form, like evaporated chemicals. Neigh, neigh, said my heart, or perhaps nay, nay—it was hard to know. 6. Here the vision ended. I was in my bed, the morning sun contentedly rising, the feather comforter mounded in white drifts over my lower body. You had been with me— there was a dent in the second pillowcase. We had escaped from death— or was this the view from the precipice?2.

Peter did not enjoy himself anymore. He never would again. The brooding lettuces in their falcon hoods. The coppice gate wound shut by weeds, the jaws of life trying to keep it closed tight but anyone can climb it. As a child I played on a gate in a neighborhood park that swung of itself and sounded like the distress call of a rabbit. I stood on the bottom slat and backed in and out of the air. I’ll never get out of here. The gate was pure folly, without fencing on either side, Greek tragedy staged around a doorway the imagination strains to enter. I was raised in an aisle seat with an eye line of an actor about to come through from behind it. Melodramatic onions grew wild. I cried and cried until someone said it’s O.K. to cry, it means the onions are fresh. Every dream begins with a threshold. Meat in the driveway where dogs tipped the garbage. Where’s your mouth? There is a whistle you can buy that makes the sound of a rabbit screaming hunters use to call whatever they want out of the thicket because everything they want wants rabbit for dinner. Move your hand along the shaft to change the call from jack to cotton- tail and back again. Once you see them nose out of the interior at your bidding what stops you from sounding every single day? All day? The shrill imagined rabbit’s canned terror. You can do it with a reed of grass. Cup your hands. Everything alive is listening. I knew a hunter who could do a spot-on fawn whose suffering would bring a doe into the open every time. He didn’t want a doe, though. He wanted a buck. Here’s what I can’t stand to acknowledge: when bucks hear the sound of the fawn my friend makes with his mouth they come, too, not in pity, but in lust, so badly they want the doe drawn by the yearning of a fawn in need of her. Everything is within range suddenly and who am I to judge. He mounts her relief and spring comes. No. He takes a bullet.

Let me start with the drive to the farm as darkness was sinking back into the earth. The road damp and shining like the snail’s silver ribbon and the orchard with its bony branches. I loved the yellow rubber aprons and the way Janet knotted my broken strap. And the stainless-steel altars we bleached, Brian sharpening the knives, testing the edge on his thumbnail. All eighty-eight Cornish hens huddled in their crates. Wrapping my palms around their white wings, lowering them into the tapered urn. Some seemed unwitting as the world narrowed; some cackled and fluttered; some struggled. I gathered each one, tucked her bright feet, drew her head through the kill cone’s sharp collar, her keratin beak and the rumpled red vascular comb that once kept her cool as she pecked in her mansion of grass. I didn’t look into those stone eyes. I didn’t ask forgiveness. I slid the blade between the feathers and made quick crescent cuts, severing the arteries just under the jaw. Blood like liquor pouring out of the bottle. When I see the nub of heart later, it’s hard to believe such a small star could flare like that. I lifted each body, bathing it in heated water until the scaly membrane of the shanks sloughed off under my thumb. And after they were tossed in the large plucking drum I loved the newly naked birds. Sundering the heads and feet neatly at the joints, a poor man’s riches for golden stock. Slitting a fissure reaching into the chamber, freeing the organs, the spill of intestines, blue-tinged gizzard, the small purses of lungs, the royal hearts, easing the floppy liver, carefully, from the green gall bladder, its bitter bile. And the fascia unfurling like a transparent fan. When I tug the esophagus down through the neck, I love the suck and release as it lets go. Then slicing off the anus with its gray pearl of shit. Over and over, my hands explore each cave, learning to see with my fingertips. Like a traveller in a foreign country, entering church after church. In every one the same figures of the Madonna, Christ on the Cross, which I’d always thought was gore until Marie said to her it was tender, the most tender image, every saint and political prisoner, every jailed poet and burning monk. But though I have all the time in the world to think thoughts like this, I don’t. I’m empty as I rinse each carcass, and this is what I love most. It’s like when the refrigerator turns off and you hear the silence. As the sun rose higher we shed our sweatshirts and moved the coolers into the shade, but, other than that, no time passed. I didn’t get hungry. I didn’t want to stop. I was breathing from some bright reserve. We twisted each pullet into plastic, iced and loaded them in the cars. I loved the truth. Even in just this one thing: looking straight at the terrible, one-sided accord we make with the living of this world. At the end, we scoured the tables, hosed the dried blood, the stain blossoming through the water"}

When I try to shoo them away he squats down to eye level, takes my right hand delicately in his, shakes his head, and mumbles what might be a prayer or words of advice or a curse. I don’t know because no one here—neither the sellers nor the buyers—speaks a language I understand. An old grandfather whose white hair halos his head sits cross-legged on the damp grass smoking his pipe, his eyes closed. His wares: a pyramid of stained teeth. Shall I assume he is the dentist of the town? There is no town, only fields of long grass blowing in the wind and beyond the wind the gray mountains. A young woman, her forehead and cheeks a web of delicate tattoos, holds out a bowl of red powder. Her eyes are so alive I have to look away. She licks a forefinger, then jabs it into the powder and offers me a taste. Blue and white pennants fly from the tent poles. Women and children on muleback stream down from the hills or from nowhere. The powder tastes like nothing I know, not bitter like orange rind nor sweet like ground rose petals nor bland like dyed flour. I had heard there were storks nesting on the haystacks and on the tallest chimneys of the remote villages, and that wild, black-winged falcons circled the fields all day keeping watch over the land, feeding on whatever came to rest. I saw none of that; the only birds were tiny and caged, beating their wings against the bars, chattering like distant voices in dreams. I’ve forgotten how I got there. I know I knelt to a cold stream to wash my face and wakened to music, an odd beat, a melody I’d heard before. I followed the sound over a rise to the open field where the sun poured down its grace on the long grass, the animals, the men and women. The wind kept prodding at my back as though determined to push me away from where I was, fearful, perhaps, I would come to rest"}

A shadow as of vast wings passed across them, in a manner of speaking: he slept, the small bud of face unclenched. Later on, still drowsing, he was relatively certain he had at some point overheard her claim that while nursing he never stopped staring into her eyes, which was fair enough; but when she added that she felt like she was being judged, right away he sensed things getting out of hand. That night he lay awake pondering the matter for many hours, compelled at last to find her accusation jejune, massively unsubstantiated, unwitnessed by anyone but the accuser, pathetically, and tinged with paranoia— not a trait, incidentally, you are happy to see in the person with whom you’ll be sharing the next couple decades. I have done no such thing, he concluded.

I’d climb onto the iron seat with a threadbare pad that made my ass sweat, a jug of iced tea wrapped in burlap, a bandanna knotted to keep dust out of my mouth, goggles snapped onto my face like an ideologue’s dream so that I saw the fields foursquare as I contour-plowed acre after acre unfolding before me with such dialectical rigor that the ground of being would hold still forever, never blowing into reactions of horizon-shrouding dust whipped by the hot winds of contingency. Such a theory Marx made to argue the enigma into sense— and not just for himself but for the eponymous masses! But my grandfather’s big nose and wary drinker’s eyes keep breaking through the mask and posing an alternative enigma: what if his surplus value led him not to solidarity with the worker but instead made him into a kulak who must be killed? So the locomotive pulls out of the Finland Station, so the colors red and white make uniforms for themselves: Lenin. Trotsky. Moth-eaten Tsar Nicholas. Technicolor Rasputin. The ones who stood in front of Kresty Prison for three hundred hours. But the colors saw them coming— and wore the ones who wore them to rags. But fast-forward a hundred years, my grandfather dead for fifty, and there, in a window on Fifth Avenue, the enigma hides itself in the headless, sexless torso of a mannequin as a fly lands on its finger, the window shattering to a thousand windows in the lenses of its eyes. And all the while the enigma, like the embalmed body of Lenin, keeps on breathing through his waxworks face"}

The olive tree had been hard-pruned along its central branch and only the tips were in leaf, gray fingers stretching to light, but you could see the new growth, a haze of turquoise rust. Roots had blistered the sea-pebble paving into a mound like a verruca. I thought of the black ceramic bird my mother notched in the center of her pies, whose yellow beak cracked the crust. He had a cello in his hand. The grain glowed peat-swirl brown of a mountain tarn, but plum-maroon under the f-holes as if someone had been at it with mammoth blood. The spike glittered between one round stone and the next. Take this, he said. I’m giving it to you. I looked away, at marble grooves framing the half-dome niche where a tap hangs over the copper cup chained to the wall. I ran my finger down the neck and scroll. I imagined lifting a handle stuck to the lip of a broken amphora face down under the tree, like history keeping a lid on rising roots. Every choice is a loss. The past is not where you left it. That corridor you didn’t follow, the gate to unknown woods, shadow grin of a winding stair, the door you never found time to open—they whirl within, cracking the floor.

So instead I yell “Hey,” loud and bellowish as I can, and he leaps half a man high and runs away a little ways, then stops, turns to see, and rises to his hind legs, surmises I’m nothing much, adopts a casual pose and sits. He licks a forepaw’s pad, so that the top of his head is what the half-inch hex nut slung by the slingshot pings off of with a thock . And he spins with the shock and odd distance of it from me—sorcery it must be—and rushes into the deeper bushes and oncoming greenery, then into the distances the mountain gives, where he lives in such circumstances as he must relearn and will have to be, again, even so hungry, able to discern."}

I still need to find a subject for such a serious theme— nothing too trivial or self-conscious.

After finding a topic (we haven’t but it’s more important to keep the damn thing moving) next up is the proper tone, which can’t be too solemn—that’s been covered by folks like Thomas Hardy who let’s face it I’m not gonna top— but also not too clever, some middle ground, tattooed chemo-nurse or stepmom-at-a-rifle-range type of deal.

The fact that he’s six-four made it all the more heartbreaking and I wondered, as the ball died in the dirt well short of first, as creative-nonfiction writers circled the bases, how he survived his childhood. Was there a father or uncle on the scene to stave off the catastrophe, hurling fastballs and “Attaboy”s in the back yard while Mother peeked through kitchen blinds? Were schoolyard bullies happy to assist with his emasculation, or did he have kind friends, a cohort of thoughtful children with international parents who cared about politics and dance and used star fruit in their cooking?

And as Great Sow Is about to charge and crush and tear My childhood out of me, I take this picture From my future, a painting from 1793, A painting from nine thousand miles away, Maybe in a place where Great Sow’s ancestors Planned their vengeance, passive for the artist, Brewing generations of contempt inside. A point of singularity is reached, epiphany In straw and swill-filled air between us (Normally, I would gate her out to change straw And water). We both grunted and she went Back to her scratching.

In arguments You’ll drag another person under water till he drowns. Though I grew very large, though I developed great capacity of mind, I was afraid of my mother. Afraid not just of scrutiny But of being the object of someone’s pride. What was I protecting? She was willful, yes, But tiny, generous to a fault.

The headache is a room where I have to stay as I cannot afford to pay rent anywhere else. Every hair aches to the point of turning gray. There is an ache inside that Gordian knot, the brain, which wants to do so much in so many directions. The ache is also a half-moon hanging down in the light-blue sky; the color disappears from my face; my nose is pointing downward; the entire divining rod is turning down toward the subterranean current. I moved into a house built in the wrong place; there is a magnetic pole just under the bed, just under my pillow, and when the weather chops around above the bed I am charged. Time and again I try to imagine that a celestial bonesetter is pinching me through a miraculous grip on my cervical vertebrae, a grip that will put life right once and for all. But the house of headache is not ready to be written off just yet. First I have to live inside it for an hour, two hours, half a day. If at first I said it was a room, change that to a house. But the question now is this: Is it not an entire city? Traffic is unbearably slow. The breaking news is out. And somewhere a telephone is ringing.

Even dismantling and back-engineering you’ll pull up short—it bears no imitations. The weight of creature and armour drives the horn deep into any Achilles’ heel, affirmation of vengeful gods: metal breastplates and cuisses, backplates and faulds without chivalry you recognize, like that unfamiliar vestigial horn—clitoral, to be stroked in violence?—forced to perform for the royal crowd, artist’s impression.

The English dubbed it Red Biddy and consumed oceans of it for a pence a flagon. Knowing nothing—then or now—about wine, I would buy a litre for 8 pesetas—12 cents— and fry my brains. Being a happy drunk, I lived a second time as a common laborer toiling all night over the classic strophes I burned in the morning, literally burned, in an oil barrel outside the Palacio Güell, one of the earliest and ugliest of Gaudí’s monuments to modernismo . Five mornings a week the foreman, Antonio, an Andalusian, with a voice of stone raked over corrugated tin, questioned the wisdom of playing with fire. He’d read Edgar Allan Poe in the translations of Valle-Inclán and believed the poets of the new world were madmen. Yes, even the women were madmen. He claimed an affair with Gabriella Mistral was the low point of his adolescence. As the weeks passed into spring and the plane trees in the courtyard of the ancient hospital burst into new green, I decided one morning to test sobriety, to waken at dawn to sparrow chirp and dark clouds blowing seaward from the Bultaco factory, to inhale the particulates and write nothing, to face the world as it was. Everything was actual, my utterances drab, my lies formulary and unimaginative. For the first time in my life I believed everything I said. Think of it: simple words in English or Spanish or Yiddish, words that speak the truth and no more, hour after hour, day after day without end, a life in the kingdom of candor, without fire or wine"}

They invented democracy— the whole people, Pericles said— imposed reason, wore bedsheets. Bore wine, water (moderation) in pleasing shapes, amphorae —the Greeks had a word.

Your ankles are two monster-truck engines but smaller and lighter and sexier than a saucer with warm milk licking the outside edge; they make me want to sing, make me want to take them home and feed them pasta, I want to punish them for being bad and then hold them all night long and say I’m sorry, sugar, darling, it will never happen again, not in a million years. Your thighs make me quiet. Make me want to be hurled into the air like a cannonball and pulled down again like someone being pulled into a van. Your thighs are two boats burned out of redwood trees. I want to go sailing. Your thighs, the long breath of them under the blue denim of your high-end jeans, could starve me to death, could make me cry and cry. Your ass is a shopping mall at Christmas, a holy place, a hill I fell in love with once when I was falling in love with hills. Your ass is a string quartet, the northern lights tucked tightly into bed between a high-count-of-cotton sheets. Your back is the back of a river full of fish; I have my tackle and tackle box. You only have to say the word. Your back, a letter I have been writing for fifteen years, a smooth stone, a moan someone makes when his hair is pulled, your back like a warm tongue at rest, a tongue with a tab of acid on top; your spine is an alphabet, a ladder of celestial proportions. When I place my fingers along it there isn’t an instrument in the world I’d rather be playing. It’s a map of the world, a time line, I am navigating the North and South of it. Your armpits are beehives, they make me want to spin wool, want to pour a glass of whiskey, your armpits dripping their honey, their heat, their inexhaustible love-making dark. Your arms are the arms of nations, they hail me like a cab. I am bright yellow for them. I am always thinking about them, resting at your side or high in the air when I’m pulling off your shirt. Your arms of blue and ice with the blood running through them. Close enough to your shoulders to make them believe in God. Your shoulders make me want to raise an arm and burn down the Capitol. They sing to each other underneath your turquoise slope-neck blouse. Each is a separate bowl of rice steaming and covered in soy sauce. Your neck is a skyscraper of erotic adult videos, a swan and a ballet and a throaty elevator made of light. Your neck is a scrim of wet silk that guides the dead into the hours of Heaven. It makes me want to die, your mouth, which is the mouth of everything worth saying. It’s abalone and coral reef. Your mouth, which opens like the legs of astronauts who disconnect their safety lines and ride their stars into the billion and one voting districts of the Milky Way.

So we couldn’t figure out how the squirrel was getting in. We each had methods that succeeded in shooing him, or her, out the door—but none of them lasted. Whether it was the same squirrel—terrified when in the house, and persistently so—or various we couldn’t tell because, tipped off by a glance, he zigzagged from froze-to-vapor, vanishing, Zorro-like, until signs would tell us he had revisited the sideboard to dig in the begonia. (Escaping Newcastle in a search for coal.) We plotted his counter- escape, laying a path of pecans to a window opening on the yard. A few days would pass, and, believing him gone, we felt inexplicably better than when we began. Then, from another room, the amplified skritch of nutmeg being grated—and, crash. Bracelets off dresser tops, bud vases, candy dishes, things houses have that the back yard doesn’t. You don’t think of squirrels knocking things over, but inside it was like living with the Ghost and Mrs. Muir. When we couldn’t trust the quiet or prove his absence, we cast him as that hapless shade: worry. Our own gray area, scat-trailing proof of feral anxiety. But after a few cycles of release-and-catch I grew bored with the idea, with its untamed projections. Since he dashes up walls, (yanked, like a pulley), or seeks treasure in a five-inch pot, daily, why not adopt him as optimism’s travelling rep? I tried. But the sun comes up, we step toward the stove, and he shoots out like a cue ball, banks off the kitchen door —what mayhem is caused by going to make coffee!— and the day, again, begins with a shriek. We are now in week three and I accept that, inside, the squirrel is going to stand for something else. And so is the May rain and so is the day you took off your coat and the tulips joined in with the cherry blossoms and the people came out and the pear-tree petals floated down in polka dots around the tulips, and even around the cars.

Wrapped in white cerements, white face more youthful and grave than I have ever seen it, frowning slightly as though it were reading, one eye blind in a blond swath of hair, vague smile like the velvet depression the lost diamond has left in its case; now strangely you are moving in a wide circle around me, stepping sideways in time to some slow stately dance hand in hand with the handless in their identical absence of affect, lips moving in unison. I can’t hear a thing, but it’s said the instant of being aware we are sleeping and the instant of waking are one and the same—and thus, against delusion we possess this defense.

How the archway and the voice and the shadow seize the small triangle of my soul violently, as in a silent film where the accompaniment becomes a mad body for the spirit’s skipping images—abandoned homeland—miracle from which we come back out alive. So here from there again I read it off the book of time, my only time, as if in there is a fatal mistake of which I cannot find the nature—or shape—or origin—I pick up the infant and place it back again to where I am a small reservoir of blood, twelve pounds of bone and sinew and other matters—already condemned to this one soul— which we are told weighs less than a feather, or as much as four ounces when grown—as if I could travel, I back up those arteries, up the precious liquid, across the field of methods, agonies, astonishments—may I not squander the astonishments— may I not mistakenly kill brother, sister—I will sit once again so boldly at my beginning, dark spot where one story does not yet become another, and words, which have not yet come to me, will not yet try to tell where each thing emerges, where it is heading, and where the flow of tendency will shine on its fast way downhill. And it will seem to me that all this is legend, one of those in which there is no way to look back and yet you do, you pay for it, yes, but you do. . . . It was a hilltop town in the south in summer. It was before I knew about knowing. My mind ran everywhere and was completely still at the center. And that did not feel uncomfortable. A bird sang, it added itself to the shadow under the archway. I think from this distance that I was happy. I think from this distance. I sat. It was before I knew walking. Only my soul walked everywhere without weight. Where the road sloped downhill there was disappearance. Which was exactly what I imagined should happen. Appearance and disappearance. In my only life. When my mother’s voice got closer it had a body. It had arms and they were holding something that must have been a basket. My mind now can go round her, come in front, and wrap her as her arms wrapped that basket. And it must have been wicker because I see in the light the many lucent browns, the white tips, as she steps out of the shadow in which nothing but her hands and the front of her act of carrying are visible. And when her body arrives it is with the many lemons entirely struck, entirely taken, by sunshine, which the heavy basket is still now carrying, and her bright fingernails woven into each other, and her face with its gaze searching for me, gaze which felt like one of the bright things she was carrying in front of herself, a new belly.

I was a parrot fed melon seeds by the eleventh caliph. I sparked to life in a Damascus forge, no bigger than my own pupil. I was the mosquito whose malarial kiss conquered Alexander. I bound books in Bukhara, burned them in Balkh. In my four hundred and sixteenth year I came to Qom. I tasted Paradise early as an ant in the sugar bin of Mehmet Pasha’s chief chef. I was a Hindu slave stonemason who built the Blue Mosque without believing. I rode as a louse under Burton’s turban when he sneaked into Mecca. I butchered halal in Jalalabad. I had been a vulture just ten years when I looked down and saw Karbala set for me like a table. I walked that lush Hafiz home and held his head while he puked. I was one of those four palm trees smart-bomb-shaken behind the reporter’s khaki vest. I threw out the English-language newspaper that went on to hide the roadside bomb.

I foresee an auction of broken rocking chairs painted farmhouse green, thick wooden skis, oil lamps, my great-grandfather’s flannel nightshirts, stacks of Youth’s Companion, lasts for resoling shoes, toys, eight stacked beds . . . I know you don’t listen, Kurt Schwitters, but pitchers and catchers drive their cars south in February, while Fenway’s baseball lies under snow. You collect yourself in the framed, deep-set collage Linda and I discovered at Yale. Idolatrous of this white farmhouse since I was ten, in my ninth decade I daydream that it burns to the ground so that nobody will empty it. My children comfort me with their care, bringing five grandchildren to visit, but none will settle in the country. When I was twelve and we didn’t hay, Kurt, the parlor radio broadcast the Red Sox games. As Henry Moore carved or modelled his sculpture every day, he strove to surpass Donatello and failed, but woke the next morning elated for another try. At eighty-five he dozed in a wheelchair. I list the objects of this long house, walking from room to room taking notes, as if I controlled or determined what happens to things after I die. In June the peonies go rotten and white old roses flourish briefly. This wooden box beside my blue chair was built by a cabinetmaker to hold the toys of his first grandson, my father, who died at fifty-two. Inside it are LPs of poets, dead and reading their work with gusto. Let them melt. Baseball will inflate, Kurt, into yearlong seasons under domes. My mother made it until ninety. All day I sit silent and alone watching the barn or TV baseball, usually grateful for the hours of isolation’s slow contentment— but I long for days when Linda comes. I ask, “What will you do when I die?” “I will sit in a chair for two years.” My grandchildren’s grandchildren will know nothing of a grassy cellar hole. Linda gave me the book “Kurt Schwitters,” with murky photos from the twenties of your Merzbaus, and ten collages footnoted as “whereabouts unknown.” Hitler’s war and our bombing wasted Hamburg, where your rash and bountiful inventions burned into ash. I think of the lost Red Sox I read about in the Boston Post: Babe Ruth long gone, Ted Williams, Mel Parnell, Bobby Doerr, Birdie Tebbetts . . . My wife Jane Kenyon died at forty-seven, no longer able to write. I imagine her at sixty, outliving hot flashes, writing in depression new poems about an old man who cannot fuck. She looks after him as he shuffles into a bent and shrivelled other. Like all shelters, Kurt—huts and mansions— this house built two centuries ago contained its end in its beginning, in its anvil-forged spikes and timbers. Benjamin Keneston, Aunt Nannie, and Wesley Wells are dead. After hours of Cheyne-Stokes breathing they went silent, as useless and beyond self-pity as broken rocking chairs painted green"}

And though it was not a good match, my person and that particular kibbutz, I did find love and travelled on to Greece, and while attempting my part in the great experiment, attempting to dovetail my history with a homeland, I remember fondly the Voice of Peace coming from a corner of the coop, off and on through the static and translation, my privacy intact, my job straightforward and finite, my picture of the boat out there off all our shores, a friend to anyone who listened"}

Impossible to express the dull light produced by the perpetually gray sky, the imperial glint of the barracklike buildings, the eternal snow on the ground. With a singular taste for enormity, they have reproduced all the classical marvels of architecture. I attend art exhibitions in spaces twenty times vaster than Hampton Court. And what paintings! A Norwegian Nebuchadnezzar commissioned the staircases of the ministries; even the flunkies that I was able to glimpse are more haughty than Brahmas and I shuddered at the colossal aspect of the caretakers and construction officials. Thanks to the ordering of buildings into squares, courtyards and enclosed terraces, cabdrivers have been kept out. The parks represent primitive nature detailed with superb technical mastery. The upper zone has inexplicable parts: an arm of the sea, with no boats, unrolls its layer of blue sleet between quays weighted with giant candelabra. A short bridge leads to a vaulted passage directly beneath the dome of the Sainte-Chapelle. This dome is an armature of artistically wrought steel approximately fifteen thousand feet in diameter. At several points on the copper footbridges, the platforms, the stairways that wind around covered markets and pillars, I thought I could judge the depth of the city! It’s the wonder of it that I was unable to seize: what are the relative levels of the other districts above or below the acropolis? For today’s tourist, orientation is impossible. The business district is a circus built in a uniform style, with arcaded galleries. No shops to be seen. But the snow on the pavement is trampled; a few nabobs as rare as Sunday morning strollers in London are making their way toward a diamond-studded stagecoach. A few red velvet divans: they serve arctic beverages whose price varies from eight hundred to eight thousand rupees. To the notion of seeking out a theater in this circus, I would reply that the shops must contain dramas that are sordid enough. I think there is a police force, but the laws must be so strange that I give up trying to imagine what the rogues here must be like. The suburb as elegant as any fine street of Paris has the advantage of air that is like light. The democratic element is made up of some hundred souls. Here too the houses don’t follow one another; the suburb loses itself bizarrely in the countryside, the “county” that fills up the eternal west of forests and prodigious plantations where savage gentlefolk hunt down their gossip columns by artificial light. “Illuminations” ( Translated, from the French, by John Ashbery. ) “Illuminations” ( Translated, from the French, by John Ashbery. )"}

His wife makes good egusi, he tells me, with stockfish, dry fish, and crayfish, with local Nsukka Maggi; with goat meat or beef meat, and, of course, pounded egusi, protein-rich seeds of a large-seeded variety of watermelon, fried in palm oil first— be careful the oil doesn’t splash—and you must remove the bones from the dry fish and break into big pieces, add chili and pepper to taste. For maximum flavor, add curry powder and thyme. I like a lot of chili, do you like things hot, he asks me? Then, at the end, she throws in bitter leaf or ugwu or celosia. It helps if you have a cow’s tongue, something like that, or a beef- or ox-tail. I told my father of a villager quoted by Achebe who told his wife never to give him egusi soup; so every evening the man gets to eat his favorite soup, egusi, I say. I see what you mean, I see what you mean, he says, laughing his laugh that is a little like mine. Then he put down his bowl and his spoon as if he were from a fable or a fairy tale, a bear or a woodcutter, a wolf in a frock and vanished like a cow jumping over the moon, or the dish running away with the spoon.I told my father of a villager quoted by Achebe who told his wife never to give him egusi soup; so every evening the man gets to eat his favorite soup, egusi, I say.

Winter in mid-May means the darling buds of May uncurled On an ice-cold morgue slab, smilingly shaking loose their beautiful hair. London rains every day anyway. Paris is freezing. It’s May, but Rome is cold. Motorcycles being tested at the factory in Varese north of Milan are gray Victims screaming in place and can’t get out and won’t get sold. It’s the recession. It’s very weird in New York. Teen vampires are the teen obsession, Rosebud mouths who don’t use a knife and fork. Germany at first won’t save Greece, but really has to. It’s hot hot in parts of Texas, but rain drowns Tennessee, people die. It’s the euro. It’s the Greek debt. Greece knew It had to stop lying, but timeo Danaos , they’re Greeks, Greeks lie. Canoeing in the Ozarks with Pierre Leval, the rain came down so hard The river rose twenty-three feet in the pre-dawn hours and roared. Came the dawn, there was improbably a lifeguard, There was a three-legged dog, the jobless numbers soared. Dreamers woke in the dark and drowned, with time to think this can’t be true. Incomprehensible is something these things do. They bring the Dow Jones into the Ozarks and the Ozarks into the E.U. A raving flash flood vomits out of a raindrop. The Western world is in the I.C.U. Entire trees rocket past. One wouldn’t stand a chance in the canoe. A three-legged dog appears, then the guy it belongs to. You instantly knew You’d run into a hillbilly backwoods crazy, itching to kill you. Berlin and Athens, as the Western world flickers, Look up blinking in the rain and lick the rain and shiver and freeze.

I make sure to walk the wretched ones. The others barked raucously as she ambled out of her cage into the noose of my leash, which hung slack as we shuffled past the monsters in the segregated pen— some, the workers say, are just born bad. This dog trembles in the fall chill as we watch a mist drift over the downtown skyline. Somewhere in that fog is Krystal, the woman I met Saturday night, who seemed to know everybody in the bar but kept circling back to me, even after she let some crazy asshole lick her eyeball. At closing time she gave me her number, and I figured, doing the math, her younger age and good breasts plus nice face minus the acne scars, which didn’t matter to me, but probably did to her, equalled my first Oklahoma girl. But when I called she talked only about herself, her careers, her degrees, her deep spirituality, her power to literally make the sun come out whenever she felt like it. I thought she was just misusing the word “literally,” as often happens, but no, she meant it, and if I were younger I’d have challenged her, but instead I just got depressed, more depressed after the sex. Better to be here with this miserable bitch watching the clouds roll in. She’s leaning against me now, and I can’t help but pat her grubby shoulder, rest my chin on her head.

Whether the chitchat of the surgical nurses—a daughter’s quote boyfriend unquote, or mother-in-law as genus and species, or which the better napkin at Thanksgiving, cloth or paper—all presses into the brain of the anesthetized woman to do something, I don’t know.

There are pieces of war only the dead can bear, horses in old photographs bloated and levelled, trees cut to the nub. That’s the first shock before what might be human bodies in the foreground. And whether woods get autumnal for a reason, leaf on leaf flaring red-gold just to fall down, dream in spite of the real afternoon, I have no idea. Whether childhood matters, I don’t know that. Whether broken bones there, the split knees and lip, confessions unconfessed, trips alone to the basement’s dank underworld quiet in its way as the ticking clock made the room upstairs, if that matters at all to strengthen bones now, to attack the baddest bad blood cells in the universe, I’ll never know. Whether the brain has hobbies other than notions of a possible afterlife, angel or no angel, loved ones lined up radiant after the train wreck of getting there, for the long wait to see us again— who the hell knows. Whether one can get better, better than what dark goes on in vessel, in chamber, the blind ride down the nerve—I’d have to take night, flood it with day and more day. Whether whether even counts as an option in genuine truth-telling—shouldn’t that be a thunderbolt? Minus the should. For that matter, minus thunder, too. It’s the bolt: to be beside oneself.

The differences between these two figures were much more striking than the differences between the Cornish hen and the trout amandine I was wavering between, so I looked up and closed my menu. If, the man with the tie continued, an object moving through space will never reach its destination because it is always limited to cutting the distance to its goal in half, then it turns out that St. Sebastian did not die from the wounds inflicted by the arrows. No, the cause of death was fright at the spectacle of their endless approach. St. Sebastian, according to Zeno, would have died of a heart attack. I think I’ll have the trout, I told the waiter, for it was now my turn to order, but all through the elegant dinner I kept thinking of the arrows forever nearing the pale, quivering flesh of St. Sebastian a fleet of them perpetually halving the tiny distances to his body, tied to a post with rope, even after the archers had packed it in and gone home. And I thought of the bullet never reaching the wife of William Burroughs, an apple trembling on her head, the tossed acid never getting to the face of that girl, and the Oldsmobile never knocking my dog into a ditch. The theories of Zeno floated above the table like thought balloons from the fifth century before Christ, yet my fork continued to arrive at my mouth delivering morsels of asparagus and crusted fish, and after we all talked and ate and lifted our glasses, we left the restaurant and said goodbye on the street then walked our separate ways in the world where things do arrive, where people get where they are going— where the train pulls into the station in a cloud of vapor, where geese land with a splash on the surface of the lake, and the one you love crosses the room and arrives in your arms— and, yes, where sharp arrows will pierce a torso, splattering the groin and the bare feet of the saint, that popular subject of European religious painting. One hagiographer compared him to a hedgehog bristling with quills.The differences between these two figures were much more striking than the differences between the Cornish hen and the trout amandine I was wavering between, so I looked up and closed my menu.

I like how the morning’s rain, having wakened the soil’s raw materials, sends a root smell into the air around us, which the pine trees sway stately within. I like how the sun strains not to go down, how the horizon tugs gently at it, and how the distant grain elevator’s shadow ripples over the stubble of the field. I like the bird feeder’s slant and the dribble of its seeds. I like the cat’s sleepiness as the breeze then the wind then the breeze keeps combing her fur. I like the body of the mouse at her feet. I like the way the apple core I tossed away has browned so quickly. It is much to be admired, as is the way the doe extends her elegant neck in its direction, and the workings of her black nostrils, too. I like the sound of the southbound truck blowing by headed east. I like the fact that the dog is not barking. I like the ark of the house afloat on the sea of March, and the swells of the crop hills bedizened with cedillas of old snow. I like old snow. I like my lungs and their conversions to the gospel of spring. I like the wing of the magpie outheld as he probes beneath it for fleas or lice.

And often the poor man sleepless on the roof of his country hovel, lying in the open air all night, jumps up time and time again to watch the progress of the fearful boiling, spilling out of the inexhaustible womb onto the sandy mountainside, on which the shore of Capri gleams reflected, and the port of Naples, and Mergellina. And if he sees it coming close, or hears his well water gurgling agitated, he frantically collects his wife and children, and, fleeing with as many of their things as they can carry, watches from afar their longtime nest and the small field that was their one defense from hunger fall prey to the burning flood, which advances hissing and unstoppable, to pour over them unendingly. Extinct Pompeii returns to the celestial light from her immemorial oblivion like a buried skeleton that greed or piety has raised out of the earth into the air, and from the empty forum the wanderer, gazing down the rows of broken colonnades, contemplates the distant double peak and its smoking crest, still menacing the scattered ruin. And in the horror of the hidden night, in the empty theaters, the broken temples, and ruined houses where the bat conceals its offspring, advancing cruelly through vacant buildings like an evil torch the gleaming, deadly lava flows, and glows red among the distant shadows, dyeing everything around. So, ignorant of man and of the age that he calls ancient, and of the descendants following their ancestors, nature stays evergreen; indeed she travels such a long road she might as well be standing still. Meanwhile kingdoms fall, languages and peoples die; she doesn’t see. Yet man takes it upon himself to praise eternity.( Translated, from the Italian, by Jonathan Galassi. )"}

I played a tune that worked its way into my muscles &amp; I knew I had to speak of what I’d seen before the serpent drew back its head. I saw a stall filled with human things, an endless list of names, a hill of shoes, a room of suitcases tagged to nowhere, eyeglasses, toothbrushes, baby shoes, dentures, ads for holiday spas, &amp; a wide roll of thick cloth woven of living hair. If I never possessed these reed flutes &amp; drums, if my shadow stops kissing me because of what I have witnessed, I shall holler to you through my bones, I promise you"}

You and I were playing Frisbee because we’d fought all day, and it’s a tonic to get outside and throw the sharp disk at one another with cold dumb hands. Then the animals appeared. Horses—male, I think—a pair of grayish steeds climbed the man-cleared path to the softball field in Prospect Park, where we stood at a distance. “Wow,” you said, “horses,” but I missed them at first. I was chasing down the disk that overshot, banked above, and hissed in the sky, a flattened apple. I had had it. “Baby,” I almost said, “I’m trying to make a catch here.” But I was stopped instead, lofted like the Frisbee. It was the word “ horses” in Brooklyn air. It was their bodies in Brooklyn in 2007. Though what is the good of horses in Brooklyn in 2007? As the first came he bowed his head with one step and hoisted with the next, nodding like a drunk to nobody he knows, so slowly that, within the machinations of a single nod, I revised this scene a dozen times and made a fine behind-the-back Frisbee snatch to boot. And yes, I remembered the horses of Achilles, the chariot of Israel, and Emily’s toward Eternity. . . Sometime I’d like to discuss the horses at length. Meanwhile the second horse did whatever I say the first horse did, which is walk, and smoke breath, glimmer, and gloom. They both shouldered through the intermittent aeons of twilight as mitigated by black tree shafts. There were riders, too— there must have been. They wore fancy sweaters— red, or was it blue? I even thought to go to them, gently, and stare into their eyes (the horses, I mean) to see the candles on the horse-shaped altar inside— horses are, perhaps, more lovely than a Frisbee— but that’s not what happened, honey.

Through wild gorse and sea wrack, through heather and torn wool you ran, pulling me by the hand, so I might see this for once in my life: the spin and spin of light, the whirring of it, light in search of the lost, there since the era of fire, era of candles and hollow-wick lamps, whale oil and solid wick, colza and lard, kerosene and carbide, the signal fires lighted on this perilous coast in the Tower of Hook. You say to me stay awake, be like the lensmaker who died with his lungs full of glass, be the yew in blossom when bees swarm, be their amber cathedral and even the ghosts of Cistercians will be kind to you. In a certain light as after rain, in pearled clouds or the water beyond, seen or sensed water, sea or lake, you would stop still and gaze out for a long time. Also when fireflies opened and closed in the pines, and a star appeared, our only heaven. You taught me to live like this. That after death it would be as it was before we were born. Nothing to be afraid. Nothing but happiness as unbearable as the dread from which it comes. Go toward the light always, be without ships"}

Its Boer heritage is scripted in its brown head, floppy basset-hound ears, and wind-tunnelled horns, curved back for swiftness. Boer goats merged prosaically into the feral population to increase carcass quality. To make wild meat. Purity cult of culling made vastly more profitable. It’s a narrative. Goat has one hoof missing—just a stump where it kicks and scratches its chin, back left leg hobbling, counter- balanced on rocks. Clots of hair hang like extra legs off its flanks. It is beast to those who’d make devil out of it, conjure it as Pan in the frolicking growth of the rural, an easer of their psyches when drink and blood flow in their mouths. To us, it is Goat who deserves to live and its “wanton destruction” the ranger cites as reason for shooting on sight looks laughable as new houses go up, as dozers push through the bush, as goats in their pens bred for fibre and milk and meat nibble forage down to the roots. Goat can live and we don’t know its whereabouts. It can live outside nationalist tropes. Its hobble is powerful as it mounts the outcrop and peers down the hill. Pathetic not to know that it thinks as hard as we do, that it can loathe and empathize. Goat tells me so. I am being literal. It speaks to me and I am learning to hear it speak. It knows where to find water when there’s no water to be found—it has learned to read the land in its own lifetime and will breed and pass its learning on and on if it can.

What if Father Quinn had said, “Of course you’ll recognize your parents in Heaven,” instead of “Being one with God will make your mother and father pointless.” That was back when I was young enough to love them absolutely though still fear for their place in Heaven, imagining their souls like sponges full of something resembling street water after rain. Still my mother sent me every Saturday to confess, to wring the sins out of my small baffled soul, and I made up lies about lying, disobeying, chewing gum in church, to offer them as carefully as I handed over the knotted handkerchief of coins to the grocer when my mother sent me for a loaf of Wonder, Land of Lakes, and two Camels. If guilt is the damage of childhood, then eros is the fall of adolescence. Or the fall begins there, and never ends, desire after desire parading through a lifetime like the Ringling Brothers elephants made to walk through the Queens-Midtown Tunnel and down Thirty-fourth Street to the Garden. So much of our desire like their bulky, shadowy walking after midnight, exiled from the wild and destined for a circus with its tawdry gaudiness, its unspoken pathos. It takes more than half a century to figure out who they were, the few real loves-of-your-life, and how much of the rest— the mad breaking-heart stickiness—falls away, slowly, unnoticed, the way you lose your taste for things like popsicles unthinkingly. And though dailiness may have no place for the ones who have etched themselves in the laugh lines and frown lines on the face that’s harder and harder to claim as your own, often one love-of-your-life will appear in a dream, arriving with the weight and certitude of an elephant, and it’s always the heart that wants to go out and wash the huge mysteriousness of what they meant, those memories that have only memories to feed them, and only you to keep them clean."}

The voice of Baal explodes, raging and rumbling round the clouds, frantic to crush the self-sufficient spaces and re-impose his failed hegemony in Canaan before moving on to other simpler places. At length the twining chords run thin, a watery sun shines out, the deluge slowly ceases, the guttural chant subsides; a thrush sings, and discordant thirds diminish like an exhausted concert on the subdominant.

That one sees it and sees it but sometimes it sees you, too, cowering in a corner, transfixed by the crawler for the storm alert, home videos of faces left dazed by the twister, the car bomb, the war always beginning or already begun, always the special report, the inside scoop, the hidden camera revealing the mechanical lives of the sad, inarticulate people we have come to know as “celebrities.” Who assigns such value, who chose these craven avatars if not the miraculous hand of the marketplace, whose torn cuticles and gaudily painted fingernails resemble nothing so much as our own? Where does the oracle reveal our truths more vividly than upon that pixillated spirit glass unless it is here, in this tabernacle of homely merchandise, a Copernican model of a money-driven universe revolving around its golden omphalos, each of us summed and subtotalled, integers in an equation of need and consumption, desire and consummation, because Hollywood had it right all along, the years are a montage of calendar pages and autumn leaves, sheet music for a nostalgic symphony of which our lives comprise but single trumpet blasts, single notes in the hullabaloo, or even less—we are but motes of dust in that atmosphere shaken by the vibrations of time’s imperious crescendo. That it never ends, O Lord. That it goes on, without pause or cessation, without pity or remorse. That we have willed it into existence, dreamed it into being. That it is our divine monster, our factotum, our scourge. That I can imagine nothing more beautiful than to propitiate such a god upon the seeds of my own heart"}

On PBS philosophers are debating what Nietzsche meant by our desire to create beyond ourselves the purest will. The sexual fire in the amber eyes of the woman Lauren Bacall is playing, perhaps? On the Western Channel the whiteness of Joel McCrea’s teeth* has survived dust storms, chewing tobacco, and his character’s nostalgia for the brutality of his tiny moment. Some believe we’ve consumed our originality, that our diorama will depict nothing. On the Disney Channel all fifty-six signers of the Declaration of Independence are shouting about the indignity of domination for everyone except perhaps those tending their fields and children. Did the man playing Nietzsche grow weary of trying to grow happiness out of pure will? Hat over heart, the man playing my father stood perpendicular to his exhausted, uneducated, immigrant shadow, weeping to our national anthem. A man stood for something, he said. Did the actor playing Marlowe understand that Marlowe stood for nothing? On the History Channel men and beasts are being slaughtered by machetes, explosions, and hangings, their swollen, mystified bodies falling into ravines, dropping to their knees screaming for their mothers and God to save them. It’s three in the morning and everywhere around me the silence stands for nothing and even the god playing God wants to sleep."}

It wasn’t a year I could argue against that kind of talk, so I cut the fowl killed on the farm a mile out—brown and silvery, wild— and put it over butter lettuce, lettuce then lime. I heated brandy in the saucepan, poured a strip of molasses slowly through the cold, slow as I’d seen a shaman pour pine tincture over the floor of my beaten house. She seemed to see my whole life by ordinance of some god who wanted me alive again. Burnt sage, blue smoke. Then sea salt shaken into the corners of violent sadness. She wrote my address across her chest to let everything listening know where my life was made. We waited, either forgetting what we were or becoming more brightly human in that pine, in her trance, in the lavender I set on the chipped sills, not a trance at all but my deliberate hand cutting from the yard part of what she required. Now wait longer, she said, and I did as I would when the molasses warmed over the pot enough to come into the brandy, to come into the night begun by small confessions— that this was just a rental, and mine just a floor, that the woman he loved was with another man, his mother mad, his apartment haunted in the crawl space. Then I told of the assault at daybreak between the houses. Heat, asphalt, all of it and my face toward the brick school where the apostolate studied first-century script and song. There must have been chanting, as it was on the hour. What we said was liturgy meant only for us and for that night. Not for anyone else to repeat, live by, believe. Never that.

And my dresses they are lifted like brides come to rest on the bedstead, crucifixes, dresses tangled in trees in the rooms of my heart.

Or would the connection between the comic and the appalling, as it pertained to clowns, be suddenly so clear that you’d be paralyzed by it? And if you were the clown, and my friend hesitated, as he did, would you make a sad face, and with an enormous finger wipe away an imaginary tear? How far would you trust your art?

Only where she was born, and only for One creature, will she give up everything Simply because she is adored; and he Must sacrifice himself.

Imagine how his daughters felt, sitting in cafés, virgins listening to young lawyers.

The daughters, who could not listen anymore, worked into first-date conversation, “Of course I’ve had it in the ear before.” There were no second dates. Fierce Chrysippus sisters, full of hate.

It never happened. In the old country before the Great War, my people were merchants and butchers, and then the killings drove the family first to England, then Canada, then here. My father’s brother had a shoe repair shop for a time on Brush Street; he’d learned the trade from his father back in Kiev. My mother’s family was in junk. The men were huge, thick chested, with long arms and great scarred hands. My uncle Leo could embrace a barrel of scrap metal, laugh out his huge laugh, and lift it up just for the joy. His wife, Rebecca, let her hair grow out in great wiry tangles and carried her little fists like hammers. Late summer Sundays we’d drive out to the country and pick armloads of sweet corn, boil them in sugar, and eat and eat until we couldn’t. Can you believe those people would let dogs take what was theirs, would cross an ocean and a continent to let anyone or anything dictate? After dark these same men would drink out on the front steps. The neighbors claimed they howled at the moon. Another lie. Sometimes they told stories of life back in Russia, stories I half-believed, of magic escapes and revenge killings, of the gorgeous Ukrainian girls they had. One night they tore up the lawn wrestling, until Leo triumphed, Leo in his vested suit, gray and sweat-stained. My uncle Josef was different; tall and slender, he’d come into the family through marriage here in Michigan. A pensive, gentle man, when stray dogs came to the back door of the shoe shop he’d let them in, even feed them. Their owners, he told me, barely had enough to feed themselves. Uncle Josef would take a battered pair of work shoes and cut the soles off with a hooked cobbler’s knife and then, drawing one nail at a time from his mouth, pound on a new sole. He’d pry off the heel and do the same. I was just a kid, seven at most, and never tired of watching how at the polishing wheel the leather took on its color and began to glow. Once he made a knife for me, complete with a little scabbard that looped around my belt. The black handle, too, was leather, taken from a boot no one reclaimed. He pounded and shaped it until it felt like stone. Whenever you’re scared, he told me, just rub the handle three times and nothing bad can happen"}

Perhaps this beautiful blond woman, screeching to a stop in a lilac Mercedes, pursued by wailing police cars, finally understands that it is not only for the soul but for the mind that happiness is a necessity? “Is the rich bimbo stoned or just stupid?” an old man, radiant with rage, screams. Perhaps everyone secretly admires something momentous about himself, with the mass and “inner life” of a cathedral, in the tradition of the Spanish saints and mystics who cherished the bliss of infinite sacrifice? Perhaps this street remembers the loneliness of war widows, the roll calls of absent names, its first kisses on the corner of West Tenth Street, the swooning confetti heat of victory, the scalding springs of defeat? Indeed, this street is a wave of advocacy and streaming window peonies and tulips, a fierce glimpse of history, an echoing of nightly gunshots, a flag of black pigeons flowing east toward the end of a continent, a hunger for immortality, a tiny brusque city, a bickering idea, a useless boutique, a fertile song widening into a love for all that lives"}

Yes, that is soon to be my age. (And not fifty-eight. No way. That Wikipedia is a bunch of liars.) Nope, not any other age, just forty. What other age could someone born in 1969 (and not 1951) Possibly be? (And please do not listen to my ex-wife, that sad, bitter woman in her late fifties.) What does it feel like, old bones? Yes, I have lost a step or two in the hundred-metre dash. I accept these changes. But if a guy says in a published poem that he is forty, As I am doing here, It’s obvious that must be the age that he is, Officially. II. Cattail down blows from the swamp like smoke, Ice bares its teeth on the surface of the mud puddles. It is fall—but not for me in any metaphorical sense, Because forty, while not technically all that young, is hardly like “the autumn of life” or anything; And also because Natalie Portman, the famous actress, Is in love with me. And why not? After all, there is not that much difference, age-wise, Between a person who I guess is in her mid-to-late twenties And a person who is only just turning forty, I.e., me. III. You walk across the room carrying a bouquet of phlox in your hand (“You” being Natalie Portman, the famous actress) As a present for me on my upcoming fortieth birthday. Come sit beside me, my dear, And I will tell you about my previous thirty-nine, Except for the year when I was in sixth grade, Which is a total blank. I do remember fifth grade, when we had Mrs. Erwin, And seventh grade, when we moved to the new junior-high building; But when I try to remember sixth—nothing. Let us not mourn what is lost. Sixth grade was probably not that great. Now, and on into the serious years that lie ahead, You and I will have each other. IV. An alert reader may point out That we did not move to the new junior-high building during the 1981-82 school year (As would fit with my being in seventh grade and having been born in 1969) But eighteen years earlier, in the school year of 1963-64. This is baloney! Whoever says such statements is wrong. I think that when it comes to the details of my own life My own word should be trusted over that of some random reader, Thank you! V. Unfortunately, because of this business About when we did or didn’t move to the new junior-high building, Natalie Portman’s suspicions somehow were raised, And she had a completely unnecessary “background check” run on me, And then left me for Shia LaBeouf, Who is hot right now. VI. This poem is becoming a disaster. It happens sometimes— I get into a poem, and the thing goes haywire, And I don’t know how to get out. According to some nitpicker at the Ohio Department of Education, Mrs. Roberta Erwin retired and left teaching entirely in 1967, Two years before my birth. Thus, the argument goes, She could not have taught me fifth grade, As I claimed in Canto III. VII. Look, I am turning forty, all right? Let’s just leave it at that. Critics and people in the media who would ruin a celebration with this kind of “gotcha” behavior make me sick. If you still doubt me, Please be assured that this magazine has a rigorous policy of fact checking, And all the information in this poem has been checked, And directly verified with me. VIII. Well, it’s going to be great being forty. I am looking forward to it. There are plenty of other beautiful actresses around; I may also try out for the forty-and-over division On the National Professional Rodeo Association tour.

That they divorced us well before my birth and raised me in a faraway land of unicorns and you in the Bloc, eating cabbage and drinking Becherovka, now seems tolerable baggage for these waves, which brandish so prettily. Yet just how the old guys did it seems not too wide of. Dare you to ask how he took our brother aside between one alp and another on that Austrian postcard and punted: Where would you like to grow up? Father had muscle enough to ask such a thing of his only son and son had the stiff upper to say: Yes, run me away from my mother and sister. Did his yellow hair luff in a gust as he stood there turning the question around in his mouth? Did he stare and pocket his fists? It was, even to a twelve-year-old, obvious. He said so, granted going West, possessing what he’d soon get more of, belief, a style of ampleness—not without doubt but without the files of teeth that make food of us from inside. Thanks, then, to his head, gut, nerve the four of us boarded a Lufthansa flight and this poem is written in English, more or less. But those were different times. To marry and remarry and reproduce bent you to the hoax; exeunt with care and scrapes. We, sister, have our degrees of pleasure and our tantrums when they fail to please."}

Red with dragons front and back and gold studs around that held the drumhead tight. If you had a triangle, you didn’t really make music.

Aspiring like steeples inky green, they spear the sun-bleached view with nodding tips. How not to think of death? Its ghastly blank lies underneath your dreams, that once gave rise to horn-hard, conscienceless erections. Just so, your waking brain no longer stiffens with careless inspirations—urgent news spilled in clenched spasms on the virgin sheets. Here in this place of arid clarity, two thousand miles from where my souvenirs collect a cozy dust, the piled produce of bald ambition pulling ignorance, I see clear through to the ultimate page, the silence I dared break for my small time. No piece was easy, but each fell finished, in its shroud of print, into a book-shaped hole. Be with me, words, a little longer; you have given me my quitclaim in the sun, sealed shut my adolescent wounds, made light of grownup troubles, turned to my advantage what in most lives would be pure deficit, and formed, of those I loved, more solid ghosts. Our annual birthday do: dinner at the Arizona Inn for only two. White tablecloth, much cutlery, décor in sombre dark-beamed territorial style. No wine, thank you. Determined to prolong our second marriages, we gave that up, with cigarettes. We toast each other’s health in water and a haze of candlelight. My imitation of a proper man, white-haired and wed to aging loveliness, has fit me like a store-bought suit, not quite my skin, but wearing well enough until, at ceremony’s end, my wife points out I don’t know how to use a finger bowl. A lightened life: last novel proofs FedExed— the final go-through, back-and-forthing till all adjectives seemed wrong, inferior to an almost glimpsed unreal alternative spoken perhaps on Mars—and taxes, state and federal, mailed. They were much more this year, thanks to the last novel’s mild success, wry fruit of terror-fear and author’s tours. Checks mailed, I stopped for gas, and plumb forgot how to release the gas-cap door. True, I’d been driving a rented car for weeks. But, too, this morning I couldn’t do the computer code for the accent grave in fin-de-siècle , one of my favorite words. What’s up? What’s left of me? My window tells me the euonymus arrives now at the last and deepest shade of red, before its leaves let go. One of my grandsons leaves a phone message for me; his voice has deepened. A cold that wouldn’t let go is now a cloud upon my chest X-ray: pneumonia. My house is now a cage I prowl, window to window, as I wait for time to take away the cloud within. The rusty autumn gold is glorious. Blue jays and a small gray bird, white-chested, decline to join the seasonal escape and flit on bushes below. Is this an end? I hang, half-healthy, here, and wait to see. A wakeup call? It seems that death has found the portals it will enter by: my lungs, pathetic oblong ghosts, one paler than the other on the doctor’s viewing screen. Looking up “pneumonia,” I learn it can, like an erratic dog, turn mean and snap life short for someone under two or “very old (over 75).” Meanwhile, our President Obama waits downstairs to be unwrapped and I, a child transposed toward Christmas Day in Shillington— air soft and bright, a touch of snow outside— pause here, one hand upon the bannister, and breathe the scent of fresh-cut evergreens. Benign big blond machine beyond all price, it swallows us up and slowly spits us out half-deafened and our blood still dyed: all this to mask the simple dismal fact that we decay and find our term of life is fixed. This giant governance, a mammoth toy, distracts us for the daytime, but the night brings back the quiet, and the solemn dark. God save us from ever ending, though billions have. The world is blanketed by foregone deaths, small beads of ego, bright with appetite, whose pin-sized prick of light winked out, bequeathing Earth a jagged coral shelf unseen beneath the black unheeding waves. My visitors, my kin. I fall into the conversational mode, matching it to each old child, as if we share a joke (of course we do, the dizzy depths of years), and each grandchild, politely quizzing them on their events and prospects, all the while suppressing, like an acid reflux, the lack of prospect black and bilious for me. Must I do this, uphold the social lie that binds us all together in blind faith that nothing ends, not youth nor age nor strength, as in a motion picture which, once seen, can be rebought on DVD? My tongue says yes; within, I lamely drown. I think of those I loved and saw to die: my Grampop in his nightshirt on the floor; my first wife’s mother, unable to take a bite of Easter dinner, smiling with regret; my mother in her blue knit cap, alone on eighty acres, stuck with forty cats, too weak to walk out to collect the mail, waving brave goodbye from her wind-chimed porch. And friends, both male and female, on the phone, their voices dry and firm, their ends in sight. My old piano teacher joking, of her latest diagnosis, “Curtains.” I brushed them off, these valorous, in my unseemly haste of greedy living, and now must learn from them. Endpoint, I thought, would end a chapter in a book beyond imagining, that got reset in crisp exotic type a future I—a miracle!—could read. My hope was vague but kept me going, amiable and swift. A clergyman—those comical purveyors of what makes sense to just the terrified— has phoned me, and I loved him, bless his hide. My wife of thirty years is on the phone. I get a busy signal, and I know she’s in her grief and needs to organize consulting friends. But me, I need her voice; her body is the only locus where my desolation bumps against its end. Stirs early: ambulances pull in far below, unloading steadily their own emergencies, and stray pedestrians cross nameless streets. Traffic picks up at dawn, and lights in the skyscrapers dim. The map of Beacon Hill becomes 3-D, a crust of brick and granite, the State House dome a golden bubble single as the sun. I lived in Boston once, a year or two, in furtive semi-bachelorhood. I parked a Karmann Ghia in Back Bay’s shady spots but I was lighter then, and lived as if within forever. Now I’ve turned so heavy I sink through twenty floors to hit the street. I had a fear of falling: airplanes spilling their spinning contents like black beans; the parapets at Rockefeller Center or the Guggenheim proving too low and sucking me down with impalpable winds of dread; engorging atria in swank hotels, the piano player miles below his music, his instrument no bigger than a footprint. I’m safe! Away with travel and abrupt perspectives! Terra firma is my ground, my refuge, and my certain destination. My terrors—the flight through dazzling air, with the blinding smash, the final black—will be achieved from thirty inches, on a bed. Strontium 90—is that a so-called heavy element? I’ve been injected, and yet the same light imbecilic stuff— the babble on TV, newspaper fluff, the drone of magazines, banality’s kind banter—plows ahead, admixed with world collapse, atrocities, default, and fraud. Get off, get off the rotten world! The sky is turning that pellucid blue seen in enamel behind a girlish Virgin— the doeskin lids downcast, the smile demure. Indigo cloud-shreds dot a band of tan; the Hancock Tower bares a slice of night. So whence the world’s beauty? Was I deceived? They’ve been in my fiction; both now dead, Peggy just recently, long stricken (like my Grandma) with Parkinson’s disease. But what a peppy knockout Peggy was!— cheerleader, hockey star, May Queen, RN. Pigtailed in kindergarten, she caught my mother’s eye, but she was too much girl for me. Fred—so bright, so quietly wry— his mother’s eye fell on me, a “nicer” boy than her son’s pet pals. Fred’s slight wild streak was tamed by diabetes. At the end, it took his toes and feet. Last time we met, his walk rolled wildly, fetching my coat. With health he might have soared. As was, he taught me smarts. Dear friends of childhood, classmates, thank you, scant hundred of you, for providing a sufficiency of human types: beauty, bully, hanger-on, natural, twin, and fatso—all a writer needs, all there in Shillington, its trolley cars and little factories, cornfields and trees, leaf fires, snowflakes, pumpkins, valentines. To think of you brings tears less caustic than those the thought of death brings. Perhaps we meet our heaven at the start and not the end of life. Even then were tears and fear and struggle, but the town itself draped in plain glory the passing days. The town forgave me for existing; it included me in Christmas carols, songfests (though I sang poorly) at the Shillington, the local movie house. My father stood, in back, too restless to sit, but everybody knew his name, and mine. In turn I knew my Granddad in the overalled town crew. I’ve written these before, these modest facts, but their meaning has no bottom in my mind. The fragments in their jiggled scope collide to form more sacred windows. I had to move to beautiful New England—its triple deckers, whited churches, unplowed streets— to learn how drear and deadly life can be. All praise be Valium in Jesus’ name: a <em class=\"small\">CAT -scan needle biopsy sent me up a happy cul-de-sac, a detour not detached from consciousness but sweetly part— I heard machines and experts murmuring about me— a dulcet tube in which I lay secure and warm and thought creative thoughts, intensely so, as in my fading prime. Plans flowered, dreams. All would be well, I felt, all manner of thing. The needle, carefully worked, was in me, beyond pain, aimed at an adrenal gland. I had not hoped to find, in this bright place, so solvent a peace. Days later, the results came casually through: the gland, biopsied, showed metastasis. With what stoic delicacy does Virginia creeper let go: the feeblest tug brings down a sheaf of leaves kite-high, as if to say, To live is good but not to live—to be pulled down with scarce a ripping sound, still flourishing, still stretching toward the sun— is good also, all photosynthesis abandoned, quite quits. Next spring the hairy rootlets left unpulled snake out a leafy afterlife up that same smooth-barked oak. Why go to Sunday school, though surlily, and not believe a bit of what was taught? The desert shepherds in their scratchy robes undoubtedly existed, and Israel’s defeats— the Temple in its sacredness destroyed by Babylon and Rome. Yet Jews kept faith and passed the prayers, the crabbed rites, from table to table as Christians mocked. We mocked, but took. The timbrel creed of praise gives spirit to the daily; blood tinges lips. The tongue reposes in papyrus pleas, saying, Surely —magnificent, that “surely”— goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life , my life, forever.Cypresses have one direction, up, but sometimes desert zephyrs tousle one so that a branch or two will stick straight out— a hatchling fallen from the nest, a broken leg a limp will not forget, a lock of cowlicked hair that spurns the comb.

I hang, half-healthy, here, and wait to see. _____ November 6, 2008 A wakeup call? It seems that death has found the portals it will enter by: my lungs, pathetic oblong ghosts, one paler than the other on the doctor’s viewing screen. Looking up “pneumonia,” I learn it can, like an erratic dog, turn mean and snap life short for someone under two or “very old (over 75).” Meanwhile, our President Obama waits downstairs to be unwrapped and I, a child transposed toward Christmas Day in Shillington— air soft and bright, a touch of snow outside— pause here, one hand upon the bannister, and breathe the scent of fresh-cut evergreens. _____ Mass. General, Boston, November 23-27, 2008 Benign big blond machine beyond all price, it swallows us up and slowly spits us out half-deafened and our blood still dyed: all this to mask the simple dismal fact that we decay and find our term of life is fixed. This giant governance, a mammoth toy, distracts us for the daytime, but the night brings back the quiet, and the solemn dark. God save us from ever ending, though billions have. The world is blanketed by foregone deaths, small beads of ego, bright with appetite, whose pin-sized prick of light winked out, bequeathing Earth a jagged coral shelf unseen beneath the black unheeding waves. _____ My visitors, my kin. I fall into the conversational mode, matching it to each old child, as if we share a joke (of course we do, the dizzy depths of years), and each grandchild, politely quizzing them on their events and prospects, all the while suppressing, like an acid reflux, the lack of prospect black and bilious for me. Must I do this, uphold the social lie that binds us all together in blind faith that nothing ends, not youth nor age nor strength, as in a motion picture which, once seen, can be rebought on DVD? My tongue says yes; within, I lamely drown. _____ I think of those I loved and saw to die: my Grampop in his nightshirt on the floor; my first wife’s mother, unable to take a bite of Easter dinner, smiling with regret; my mother in her blue knit cap, alone on eighty acres, stuck with forty cats, too weak to walk out to collect the mail, waving brave goodbye from her wind-chimed porch. And friends, both male and female, on the phone, their voices dry and firm, their ends in sight. My old piano teacher joking, of her latest diagnosis, “Curtains.” I brushed them off, these valorous, in my unseemly haste of greedy living, and now must learn from them. _____ Endpoint, I thought, would end a chapter in a book beyond imagining, that got reset in crisp exotic type a future I—a miracle!—could read. My hope was vague but kept me going, amiable and swift. A clergyman—those comical purveyors of what makes sense to just the terrified— has phoned me, and I loved him, bless his hide. My wife of thirty years is on the phone. I get a busy signal, and I know she’s in her grief and needs to organize consulting friends. But me, I need her voice; her body is the only locus where my desolation bumps against its end. _____ December 11, 2008 Stirs early: ambulances pull in far below, unloading steadily their own emergencies, and stray pedestrians cross nameless streets. Traffic picks up at dawn, and lights in the skyscrapers dim. The map of Beacon Hill becomes 3-D, a crust of brick and granite, the State House dome a golden bubble single as the sun. I lived in Boston once, a year or two, in furtive semi-bachelorhood. I parked a Karmann Ghia in Back Bay’s shady spots but I was lighter then, and lived as if within forever. Now I’ve turned so heavy I sink through twenty floors to hit the street. _____ I had a fear of falling: airplanes spilling their spinning contents like black beans; the parapets at Rockefeller Center or the Guggenheim proving too low and sucking me down with impalpable winds of dread; engorging atria in swank hotels, the piano player miles below his music, his instrument no bigger than a footprint. I’m safe! Away with travel and abrupt perspectives! Terra firma is my ground, my refuge, and my certain destination. My terrors—the flight through dazzling air, with the blinding smash, the final black—will be achieved from thirty inches, on a bed. _____ Strontium 90—is that a so-called heavy element? I’ve been injected, and yet the same light imbecilic stuff— the babble on TV, newspaper fluff, the drone of magazines, banality’s kind banter—plows ahead, admixed with world collapse, atrocities, default, and fraud. Get off, get off the rotten world! The sky is turning that pellucid blue seen in enamel behind a girlish Virgin— the doeskin lids downcast, the smile demure. Indigo cloud-shreds dot a band of tan; the Hancock Tower bares a slice of night. So whence the world’s beauty? Was I deceived? _____ December 13, 2008 They’ve been in my fiction; both now dead, Peggy just recently, long stricken (like my Grandma) with Parkinson’s disease. But what a peppy knockout Peggy was!— cheerleader, hockey star, May Queen, RN. Pigtailed in kindergarten, she caught my mother’s eye, but she was too much girl for me. Fred—so bright, so quietly wry— his mother’s eye fell on me, a “nicer” boy than her son’s pet pals. Fred’s slight wild streak was tamed by diabetes. At the end, it took his toes and feet. Last time we met, his walk rolled wildly, fetching my coat. With health he might have soared. As was, he taught me smarts. _____ Dear friends of childhood, classmates, thank you, scant hundred of you, for providing a sufficiency of human types: beauty, bully, hanger-on, natural, twin, and fatso—all a writer needs, all there in Shillington, its trolley cars and little factories, cornfields and trees, leaf fires, snowflakes, pumpkins, valentines. To think of you brings tears less caustic than those the thought of death brings. Perhaps we meet our heaven at the start and not the end of life. Even then were tears and fear and struggle, but the town itself draped in plain glory the passing days. _____ The town forgave me for existing; it included me in Christmas carols, songfests (though I sang poorly) at the Shillington, the local movie house. My father stood, in back, too restless to sit, but everybody knew his name, and mine. In turn I knew my Granddad in the overalled town crew. I’ve written these before, these modest facts, but their meaning has no bottom in my mind. The fragments in their jiggled scope collide to form more sacred windows. I had to move to beautiful New England—its triple deckers, whited churches, unplowed streets— to learn how drear and deadly life can be. _____ December 22, 2008 All praise be Valium in Jesus’ name: a <em class=\"small\">CAT -scan needle biopsy sent me up a happy cul-de-sac, a detour not detached from consciousness but sweetly part— I heard machines and experts murmuring about me— a dulcet tube in which I lay secure and warm and thought creative thoughts, intensely so, as in my fading prime. Plans flowered, dreams. All would be well, I felt, all manner of thing. The needle, carefully worked, was in me, beyond pain, aimed at an adrenal gland. I had not hoped to find, in this bright place, so solvent a peace. Days later, the results came casually through: the gland, biopsied, showed metastasis. _____ With what stoic delicacy does Virginia creeper let go: the feeblest tug brings down a sheaf of leaves kite-high, as if to say, To live is good but not to live—to be pulled down with scarce a ripping sound, still flourishing, still stretching toward the sun— is good also, all photosynthesis abandoned, quite quits. Next spring the hairy rootlets left unpulled snake out a leafy afterlife up that same smooth-barked oak. _____ December 22, 2008 Why go to Sunday school, though surlily, and not believe a bit of what was taught? The desert shepherds in their scratchy robes undoubtedly existed, and Israel’s defeats— the Temple in its sacredness destroyed by Babylon and Rome. Yet Jews kept faith and passed the prayers, the crabbed rites, from table to table as Christians mocked. We mocked, but took. The timbrel creed of praise gives spirit to the daily; blood tinges lips. The tongue reposes in papyrus pleas, saying, Surely —magnificent, that “surely”— goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life , my life, forever."}
{"url": "https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/03/09/contemplation", "poetry": "I saw the fox squirrel sitting on the stand of the sundial with the twig-shaped hand. He sat still, his tail flung carelessly forward over a shoulder. The make-do tree overlooked bird feeder, lawn, and on this date a flood of snow that seemed to sublimate. A dim mist huddled by the scraggly wood; I saw it mill about, precess, stir, rise. Could we attribute to our squirrel some notion predicated on, I don’t know, image, motion, of the strangeness of this mist above snow, as if the sky were un-snowing from below? Can we name him some beauty or bewilderment to see the sharp fuzz and the near went, to feel far brittle branches’ caress and the press of space nest into the mind? Intuit yes. He clutches the twig-dial with little hands like a helmsman prefiguring close lands. His brain must be smaller than a walnut, like his snow-footprints it must course its rut from tree to tree to tree, from space to space, along dip tense liquid pivot up bough, the race and the swell of branch, dense push to earth, paws spread-eagled on a big tree’s girth. Suppose he thinks trees the same way I dress. God knows I don’t conclude the sleeve, less do I have a plan to remove a sweater. I used to put on shirts, or dresses, better, front to back, so I could seem them just as they would look on me, just as I thrust among their labyrinths. Dimly perplexed, I was too involved in what would come next— wearing the dress—to let one turn its back, to wait, to hold foreknowledge in its track. Another thing, when I was very small, at eight after the amber lamp in the hall was switched off, when the night-light shone, I used to feel one of my digits grown massive but weightless, a toe on the loom, waxing, palpitating frontiers of the room. Then obscurely it would erase, vaguely forgot. I seem to remember it happening a lot. I remember doing things I didn’t understand, “taking notes” on Marco Polo in Samarkand, clasping hands in prayer in kindergarten. I heard names—Richelieu and Spartan— with no meaning other than what I felt: a quickening of the pulse, a rufous pelt pinned with the soft gurgle of mother-of-pearl, a brick cathedral, an oil-spill whorl; something else angular and red-yellow, emanating the pre-sound of sounding hollow. The squirrel sitting on the primitive clock is stuck between no hard place and no rock, he changes and is morphous like the fog, like the sundial he swoops, he has no cog, no pause. He feels his tail hair on his fur, he knows of numbness in his toes, the slur of a breeze by his flank, and the warm instantiatedness of insides. The form of things drifts, particulates, rushes, opaquifies, holds its breath, teeters, blows, hushes. The squirrel feels out half-assumed stances, tentative conjoined smells, small knit trances. These sensations come to a head, to nought, and the fox squirrel, innocent of thought, stirs over his strange white domain, impels his tiny realm from now to what now foretells.He clutches the twig-dial with little hands like a helmsman prefiguring close lands.

And because, at my age, facts tend to switch out with mere notions like star actors being swapped out for lesser-paid stand-ins the same day I got the time wrong for a friend’s book party— and what could be more spazzy than arriving early for a book party? Not being an important actor I stayed on the scene and talked to my friend’s husband: Paul, I said, I love your painting, “Ezekiel’s Dream,” which I saw on that postcard you sent out—how big is it? He air-sketched a rectangle, tall as an old school window, and I said, Oh, I thought it was more wide than tall, at least from the postcard. Oh no, he said, it’s more tall than wide. I didn’t believe him but I wasn’t going to argue. How’s your painting going? he kindly asked. I don’t paint, I said, barely wanting to admit it since it’s so rare to be asked about work. You’re too modest! he said. We had only met a few times so I explained, No, really, Paul, I only write. Go on! he said, imitating me, I only write . Ha ha! and this sort of exchange continued for some volleys, Paul’s guffaws escalating with each of my more earnest denials. Karen, I said, finding my friend who was needed across the room because some heavy guests had started arriving, Paul is mistaking me for another friend of yours and he thinks I’m a really good painter! This is Jess , Karen said into Paul’s good ear, a thought that went directly to the voting booth and pressed the lever. He nodded, remembering, and then Karen said to me, Your hair! It’s so much darker! Darker? I asked . . . Hmmm, I stalled, trying not to embarrass anyone. Yes! she said, happy to be her honest self, much, much darker! You used to have much lighter hair!

The powerful did not have to be as fair As they are. There was one person Who was poor and powerful, like now, Same old same old. A saint. Phooey. Baloney. Secretly she owned Sony. But say the rest of us lived apart from her In the fifth season. No eternal four In which I go out alone in the car, Pass some yellow grass That is yellow to my left and makes me dizzy And yellow to my right and makes me unattached, As it is colored so in summer in Stone Harbor or Portland or Carmel Or in Denton, Texas, in ice storms, now, In the four seasons. In the fifth season Grass would be white in some clumps and pink in some clumps Everywhere else on earth, like lower Broadway Or the Champs-Élysées, Or you name it, except the few areas or towns that I just named where the four seasons were. So I say I said Whim in the fifth season, a law covering nearly all the earth. Manipulators could not manipulate, Isn’t that great? Any one person could have a whim That made counterfeit cash good And he wouldn’t be left holding the bag by counterfeiters, ruined, Just the opposite, he’d be rolling in dough. You could not rob a person with a pen, Only oral contracts counted, but not for much, And the serious people, like me, same old same old, Sat and thought how to change the white grass, And took a walk (only in the house) and thought How to change the grass, both white and pink, back into the yellow, The particular natural yellow that is hideous enough, plenty hideous"}

{"url": "https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/01/12/at-the-river", "poetry": "One night that summer my mother decided it was time to tell me about what she referred to as pleasure, though you could see she felt some sort of unease about this ceremony, which she tried to cover up by first taking my hand, as though somebody in the family had just died— she went on holding my hand as she made her speech which was more like a speech about mechanical engineering than a conversation about pleasure. In her other hand she had a book from which, apparently, she’d taken the main facts. She did the same thing with the others, my two brothers and sister, and the book was always the same book, dark blue, though we each got our own copy. There was a line drawing on the cover showing a man and woman holding hands but standing fairly far apart, like people on two sides of a dirt road. Obviously, she and my father did not have a language for what they did which, from what I could judge, wasn’t pleasure. At the same time, whatever holds human beings together could hardly resemble those cool black-and-white diagrams, which suggested, among other things, that you could only achieve pleasure with a person of the opposite sex, so you didn’t get two sockets, say, and no plug. School wasn’t in session. I went back to my room and shut the door and my mother went into the kitchen where my father was pouring glasses of wine for himself and his invisible guest who—surprise—doesn’t appear. No, it’s just my father and his friend the Holy Ghost partying the night away until the bottle runs out, after which my father continues sitting at the table with an open book in front of him. Tactfully, so as not to embarrass the Spirit, my father handled all the glasses, first his own, then the other, back and forth like every other night. By then, I was out of the house. It was summer; my friends used to meet at the river. The whole thing seemed a grave embarrassment although the truth was that, except for the boys, maybe we didn’t understand mechanics. The boys had the key right in front of them, in their hands if they wanted, and many of them said they’d already used it, though once one boy said this, the others said it too, and of course people had older brothers and sisters. We sat at the edge of the river discussing parents in general and sex in particular. And a lot of information got shared, and of course the subject was unfailingly interesting. I showed people my book, _Ideal Marriage—_we all had a good laugh over it. One night a boy brought a bottle of wine and we passed it around for a while. More and more that summer we understood that something was going to happen to us that would change us. And the group, all of us who used to meet this way, the group would shatter, like a shell that falls away so the bird can emerge. Only of course it would be two birds emerging, pairs of birds. We sat in the reeds at the edge of the river throwing small stones. When the stones hit, you could see the stars multiply for a second, little explosions of light flashing and going out. There was a boy I was beginning to like, not to speak to but to watch. I liked to sit behind him to study the back of his neck. And after a while we’d all get up together and walk back through the dark to the village. Above the field, the sky was clear, stars everywhere, like in the river, though these were the real stars, even the dead ones were real. But the ones in the river— they were like having some idea that explodes suddenly into a thousand ideas, not real, maybe, but somehow more lifelike. When I got home, my mother was asleep, my father was still at the table, reading his book. And I said, Did your friend go away? And he looked at me intently for a while, then he said, Your mother and I used to drink a glass of wine together after dinner.There was a line drawing on the cover showing a man and woman holding hands but standing fairly far apart, like people on two sides of a dirt road.

Why, yes, it’s us—we’re back, hooray, To hug you each this holiday And post sweet thoughts of you from here To neighbors round the blogosphere. Felicitations, dears and dudes, Let’s see some Yuley attitudes— Come bump the chest and dap a fist With élite types upon our list (Each of them in private thinking, This could be my Christmas inking) And wish them and their couplets well On this retrieval of Noël. Susan Choi! Jeremy Irons! May joy accrue in your environs! Let pleasant days descend, for cause, Upon the Robert Morgenthaus, And Christmas bliss, we should assume, Enfold us each and Heidi Klum. We wish a busy year-end hols To Stephen Frears, the Pussycat Dolls, Andrew Sarris, Sarah Vowell, Paris Hilton, and Colin Powell. C’mon, ’09, bring on the drama: Welcome, Pres.-elect Obama! Hail, Michelle! Historic faces! Brains let loose in higher places! Notwithstanding gloom and crisis, Cool and thinking once or twice is What we’ll need till things grow brighter— Or so says your low-rent writer. If no one minds, here’s where we hail Our friends Chris Beels and Christian Bale, And folks whose names you knew we’d know, Like Suri Cruise and Wayne Thiebaud, Bristol Palin, Dakota Fanning, Lizzie Peyton, and Peyton Manning. Carla Bruni, comment ça va ? Et Georges Cluny— connais pas ? So ha’r you doin’, George F. Will, Drew Gilpin Faust, and Dr. Phil? Yo, to speed this selfsame notion, Usain Bolt and Andrew Motion. Fetch lattes, Muse, to elevate Ric Burns and Rocco Mediate; And baby quiches, cheese or spinach, For me and Dennis J. Kucinich. We’ve mistletoe, in hope it helps To waft good will to Michael Phelps, And myrrh (spell-checked) to make the Day For Charlie Crist and Tina Fey. Come Christmas, gang, we’ll ask St. Nick To not forget Nathaniel Fick; Then drop requested toys and games On Lolo Jones and LeBron James, Plus lumps of coal from deepest pack For Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, And candy canes enough to rain Around the homes of John McCain. Jump in here, waits, in makeshift choir And lift some chords for Danny Meyer, With gladsome tunes for Teri Garr, Zaha Hadid, and David Carr; And make the lofty welkin ring O’er Miley Cyrus, Vijay Singh, And lissome late selections then For Esa-Pekka Salonen; And, lads, ere you cease this yowling, Alleluia, J. K. Rowling! Foregathered round the verdant pine With kith and kids of yours and mine, We’ll sort out gifts with Maya Lin, And call Al Gore and Christo in To clink a glass with neighbors there, Like Neal Medlyn and Sheila Bair. We’ll plan a flowing New Year’s with Alison Cool and Kiki Smith: In gala gear, in party rags, We’ll greet Snoop Dogg and Billy Wags, And similars of known renown, Like Mardy Fish and Foxy Brown. By wintry lawn we’ll dance till dawn With Sheryl Crow and Wally Shawn, J.

Don’t laugh at me For saying dumb things. Just look at this place. Time was more friend to us than enemy, And soon enough this backdrop will go dark Again. The spill of neon cream will cool, The crater waiting years for the next spark Of inspiration, since the only rule Governing history is that it goes on: There is no rhythm of events, they just Succeed each other. Soon, we will be gone, And that volcano, if and when it must, Will flood the slope with lip gloss brought to boil For other lovers who come here to spend One last, late, slap-up week in suntan oil, Their years together winding to an end. With any luck, they’ll see what we have seen: Not just the picture postcard, but the splash Of fire, and know this flowering soil has been Made rich by an inheritance of ash. Only because it’s violent to the core The world grows gardens. Out of earth we came, To earth we shall return. But first, one more Of these, delicious echoes of the flame That drives the long life all should have, yet few Are granted as we were. It wasn’t fair? Of course it wasn’t. But which of us knew, To start with, that the other would be there, One step away, for all the time it took To come this far and see a mountain cry Hot tears, as if our names, signed in the book Of marriage, were still burning in the sky?"}

Behold then the arm from which fire comes, the hand of a god hurling lightning.

Bending slightly, I held out my hands and waved them a little, wiggling my fingers. I narrowed my eyes and pursed my lips, making a tree face , and started slowly hopping on one foot, then the other, the way I imagine trees do in the forest when they’re not being watched. Maybe people would take me for a hemlock, or a tamarack. A little girl disguised as an elf looked at me skeptically. Oh, come on! her expression said. You call that acting like a tree? Behind her I could see a guy in a reindeer suit sitting down at the piano. As he hit the opening chords of “Joy to the World” I closed my eyes and tried again. This time I could feel the wind struggling to lift my boughs, which were heavy with snow. I was clinging to a mountain crag and could see over the tops of other trees a few late- afternoon clouds and the thin red ribbon of a river. I smelled more snow in the air. A gust or two whispered around my neck and face, but by now all I could hear was the meditative creaking of this neighbor or that—and a moment later, farther off, the faint but eager call of a wolf"}

Racing in a cab through springtime Central Park, I kept my nose outside the window like a dog. The stars above my bed at night are vast. I think it is uncool to call young women Ms. My darling is a platform I see stars from in the dark, And all the dogs begin to bark. My grunting gun brings down her charging warthog, And she is frying on white water, clinging to a log, And all the foam and fevers shiver. And drink has made chopped liver of my liver! Between my legs it’s Baudelaire. He wrote about her Central Park of hair. I look for the minuterie as if I were in France, In darkness, in the downstairs entrance, looking for the light. I’m on a timer that will give me time To see the way and up the stairs before the lights go out. The so delicious Busby Berkeley dancers dance A movie musical extravaganza on the staircase with me every night. Such fun! We dance. We climb. We slip in slime. We’re squirting squeezes like a wedge of lime! It’s like a shout. It’s what minuterie is all about. Just getting to the landing through the dark That has been interrupted for a minute is a lark. And she’s so happy. It is grand! I put my mobile in her ampersand. The fireworks are a fleeting puff of sadness. The flowers when they reach the stars are tears. I don’t remember poems I write. I turn around and they are gone. I do remember poor King Richard Nixon’s madness. Pierre Leval, we loved those years! We knocked back shots of single malt all night. Beer chasers gave dos caballeros double vision, second sight— Twin putti pissing out the hotel window on the Scottish dawn. A crocodile has fallen for a fawn. I live flap copy for a children’s book. He wants to lick. He wants to look. A tiny goldfinch is his Cupid. Love of cuntry makes men stupid. It makes men miss Saddam Hussein! Democracy in Baghdad makes men think Monstrosity was not so bad. I followed Gandhi barefoot to Remind me there is something else till it began to rain. The hurricane undressing of democracy in Baghdad starts to sink The shrunken page size of the New York Times , and yet we had A newspaper that mattered once, and that is sad, But that was when it mattered. Do I matter? That is true. I don’t matter but I do. I lust for fame, And after never finding it I never was the same.

I wish I were about to land on Plymouth Rock, And had a chance to do it all again but do it right. It was green dawn in pre-America.

That made the forest a cathedral clear as crystal like a cunt. Their arrows entered red meat in the glory Streaming down from the clerestory. Carine Rueff, I was obsessed—I was possessed! I liked your name. I liked the fact Marie Christine Carine Rue F was Jewish. It emphasized your elegance in Paris and in Florence. You were so blond in Rue de l’Université!

The second day, he carved a camel-bone base for the fingerboard. I sat down under his shadow with delight. The third day, he made a nut of sandalwood, and a pick guard of black cherry. He damascened a rose of horn with arabesques as lustrous as under-leaves of olive beside the sea. _ I have found him whom my soul loves._ He inlaid the sound hole with ivory swans, each pair a valentine of entangled necks, and fitted tuning pegs of apricot to give a good smell when rubbed. The fourth was a day for cutting high strings of camel gut. His left hand _ shall be under my head._ For the lower course, he twisted copper strings pale as tarmac under frost. _ He shall lie all night between my breasts._ The fifth day he laid down varnish. Our couch is green and the beams of our house _ are cedar and pine._ Behind the neck he put a sign to keep off the Evil Eye. My beloved is a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of En-gedi.

Set me as a seal upon your heart. On the sixth day the soldiers came for his genetic code. We have no record of what happened. I was queuing at the checkpoint to Galilee. I sought him and found him not. He’d have been in his open-air workshop— _ I called but he gave me no answer—_ the selfsame spot where Jesus stood when he came from Capernaum to teach in synagogue, and townsfolk tried to throw him from the rocks. Until the day break _ and shadows flee away_ I will get me to the mountain of myrrh. The seventh day we set his wounded hands around the splinters. Come with me from Lebanon, _ my spouse, look from the top_ _ of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions’ dens_. On the eighth there were no more days.

Still, the rain’s coming, maybe enough to drown the seeds. There’s a wind from the sea pushing the clouds; before you see them, you feel the wind. Better look at the fields now, see how they look before they’re flooded. A full moon. Yesterday a sheep escaped into the woods, and not just any sheep—the ram, the whole future. If we see him again, we’ll see his bones. The grass shudders a little; maybe the wind passed through it. And the new leaves of the olives shudder in the same way. Mice in the fields. Where the fox hunts, tomorrow there’ll be blood in the grass. But the storm—the storm will wash it away. In one window, there’s a boy sitting. He’s been sent to bed—too early, in his opinion. So he sits at the window— Everything is settled now. Where you are now is where you’ll sleep, where you’ll wake up in the morning. The mountain stands like a beacon, to remind the night that the earth exists, that it mustn’t be forgotten. Above the sea, the clouds form as the wind rises, dispersing them, giving them a sense of purpose. Tomorrow the dawn won’t come. The sky won’t go back to being the sky of day; it will go on as night, except the stars will fade and vanish as the storm arrives, lasting perhaps ten hours all together. But the world as it was cannot return. One by one, the lights of the village houses dim and the mountain shines in the darkness with reflected light. No sound. Only cats scuffling in doorways. They smell the wind: time to make more cats. Later, they prowl the streets, but the smell of the wind stalks them. It’s the same in the fields, confused by the smell of blood, though for now only the wind rises; stars turn the field silver. This far from the sea and still we know these signs. The night is an open book. But the world beyond the night remains a mystery"}

The test, writes Fitzgerald, in an essay called “The Crack-Up,” of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold opposing ideas in the mind at the same time yet retain the ability to function. He couldn’t, he says, so he cracked like a plate. He is trying to update Keats’s notion of “ Negative Capability , that is when a man is capable of being in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact &amp; reason—Coleridge, for instance, would let go by a fine isolated verisimilitude caught from the Penetralium of mystery, from being incapable of remaining content with half-knowledge.” When I heard the crows, like raven-geese, rending the dark, filling the falling snow with wings, I thought, for a moment, they were speaking or singing. Crows at the hour—Fitzgerald again—of the dark night of the soul, Poe-like crows chasing back and forth in a quandary or a quarrel, up and down the Gihon. Then they disappeared, let me drift back into sleep to find my hands holding my mother’s hands as if to help her rise from the cold dead dream light of Vermont.

The state bird is a chained factory gate. The state flower is Lake Superior, which sounds egotistical though it is merely cold and deep as truth. A Midwesterner can use the word “truth,” can sincerely use the word “sincere.” In truth the Midwest is not mid or west. When I go back to Michigan I drive through Ohio.

We’ve come for the Japanese electronic game that’s so hard to find. Last week, I waited three hours for a store in Manhattan to disappoint me. The first today, bundled in six layers, I stood shivering in the dawn light reading the new Aeneid translation, which I hid when the others came, stamping boots and rubbing gloveless hands, joking about sacrificing sleep for ungrateful sons. “My boy broke two front teeth playing hockey,” a man wearing shorts laughs. “This is his reward.” My sons will leap into my arms, remember this morning all their lives. “The game is for my oldest boy, just back from Iraq,” a man in overalls says from the back of the line. “He plays these games in his room all day. I’m not worried, he’ll snap out of it, he’s earned his rest.” These men fix leaks, lay foundations for other men’s dreams without complaint. They’ve been waiting in the cold since Aeneas founded Rome on rivers of blood. Virgil understood that death begins and never ends, that it’s the god of loneliness. Through the window, a clerk shouts, “We’ve only five.” The others seem not to know what to do with their hands, tuck them under their arms, or let them hang, naked and useless. Is it because our hands remember what they held, the promises they made? I know exactly when my boys will be old enough for war.

I have come this late to Italy, but better now, perhaps, than in youth that is never satisfied, whose joys are treacherous, while my hair rhymes with those far crests, and the bells of the hilltop towers number my errors, because we are never where we are, but somewhere else, even in Italy. This is the bearable truth of old age; but count your benedictions—those fields of sunflowers, the torn light on the hills, the haze of the unheard Adriatic—while the day still hopes for possibility, cloud shadows racing the slopes. The blue windows, the lemon-colored counterpane, the knowing that the sea is behind the avenue with balconies and bicycles, that the gelid traffic mixes its fumes with coffee—transient interiors, transient bedsheets, and the transient view of sea-salted hotels with spiky palms, in spite of which summer is serious, since there is inevitably a farewell to arms, to the storm-haired beauty who will disappear. The shifted absence of your axis, love wobbles on your body’s pivot, to the carriage’s shudder as it glides past the roofs and beaches of the Ligurian coast.

My neighbor stares out the window, talking to her dog. He’s sniffing the garden, trying to reach a decision about the dead flowers. It’s a little early for all this. Everything’s still very bare— nevertheless, something’s different today from yesterday. We can see the mountain: the peak’s glittering where the ice catches the light. But on the sides the snow’s melted, exposing bare rock. My neighbor’s calling the dog, making her unconvincing doglike sounds. The dog’s polite; he raises his head when she calls, but he doesn’t move. So she goes on calling, her failed bark slowly deteriorating into a human voice. All her life she dreamed of living by the sea but fate didn’t put her there. It laughed at her dreams; it locked her up in the hills, where no one escapes. The sun beats down on the earth, the earth flourishes. And every winter, it’s as though the rock underneath the earth rises higher and higher and the earth becomes rock, cold and rejecting. She says hope killed her parents, it killed her grandparents. It rose up each spring with the wheat and died between the heat of summer and the raw cold. In the end, they told her to live near the sea, as though that would make a difference. By late spring she’ll be garrulous, but now she’s down to two words, never and only , to express this sense that life’s cheated her. Never the cries of the gulls, only, in summer, the crickets, cicadas. Only the smell of the field, when all she wanted was the smell of the sea, of disappearance. The sky above the fields has turned a sort of grayish pink as the sun sinks. The clouds are silk yarn, magenta and crimson. And everywhere the earth is rustling, not lying still. And the dog senses this stirring; his ears twitch. He walks back and forth, vaguely remembering from other years this elation. The season of discoveries is beginning. Always the same discoveries, but to the dog intoxicating and new, not duplicitous. I tell my neighbor we’ll be like this when we lose our memories. I ask her if she’s ever seen the sea and she says, once, in a movie. It was a sad story, nothing worked out at all. The lovers part. The sea hammers the shore, the mark each wave leaves wiped out by the wave that follows. Never accumulation, never one wave trying to build on another, never the promise of shelter— The sea doesn’t change as the earth changes; it doesn’t lie. You ask the sea, what can you promise me and it speaks the truth; it says erasure . Finally the dog goes in. We watch the crescent moon, very faint at first, then clearer and clearer as the night grows dark. Soon it will be the sky of early spring, stretching above the stubborn ferns and violets. Nothing can be forced to live. The earth is like a drug now, like a voice from far away, a lover or master. In the end, you do what the voice tells you. It says forget, you forget.

So she goes on calling, her failed bark slowly deteriorating into a human voice. All her life she dreamed of living by the sea but fate didn’t put her there. It laughed at her dreams; it locked her up in the hills, where no one escapes. The sun beats down on the earth, the earth flourishes. And every winter, it’s as though the rock underneath the earth rises higher and higher and the earth becomes rock, cold and rejecting. She says hope killed her parents, it killed her grandparents. It rose up each spring with the wheat and died between the heat of summer and the raw cold. In the end, they told her to live near the sea, as though that would make a difference. By late spring she’ll be garrulous, but now she’s down to two words, never and only , to express this sense that life’s cheated her. Never the cries of the gulls, only, in summer, the crickets, cicadas. Only the smell of the field, when all she wanted was the smell of the sea, of disappearance. The sky above the fields has turned a sort of grayish pink as the sun sinks. The clouds are silk yarn, magenta and crimson. And everywhere the earth is rustling, not lying still. And the dog senses this stirring; his ears twitch. He walks back and forth, vaguely remembering from other years this elation. The season of discoveries is beginning. Always the same discoveries, but to the dog intoxicating and new, not duplicitous. I tell my neighbor we’ll be like this when we lose our memories. I ask her if she’s ever seen the sea and she says, once, in a movie. It was a sad story, nothing worked out at all. The lovers part. The sea hammers the shore, the mark each wave leaves wiped out by the wave that follows. Never accumulation, never one wave trying to build on another, never the promise of shelter— The sea doesn’t change as the earth changes; it doesn’t lie. You ask the sea, what can you promise me and it speaks the truth; it says erasure . Finally the dog goes in. We watch the crescent moon, very faint at first, then clearer and clearer as the night grows dark. Soon it will be the sky of early spring, stretching above the stubborn ferns and violets. Nothing can be forced to live. The earth is like a drug now, like a voice from far away, a lover or master. In the end, you do what the voice tells you. It says forget, you forget. It says begin again, you begin again."}

Words, for him, are for making arrangements, for doing business. Never for anger, never for tenderness. She strokes his back. She puts her face up against it, even though it’s like putting your face against a wall. And the silence between them is ancient: it says these are the boundaries. He isn’t sleeping, not even pretending to sleep. His breathing’s not regular: he breathes in with reluctance; he doesn’t want to commit himself to being alive.

Baring the secret beauty to the men of their season. The old men came from their one room (with its single, forbidden gas range) to watch the strippers. To remember what used to be. Like the gray-haired men of Ilium who waited each morning for Helen to cross over to the temple in her light raiment. The waning men longed to escape from the spell cast over them by time.

The dog waits for me in the doorway. Summer and winter we walk the same road, early morning, at the base of the escarpment. Sometimes the dog gets away from me—for a moment or two, I can’t see him behind some trees. He’s very proud of this, this trick he brings out occasionally, and gives up again as a favor to me— Afterward, I go back to my house to gather firewood. I keep in my mind images from each walk: monarda growing by the roadside; in early spring, the dog chasing the little gray mice so for a while it seems possible not to think of the hold of the body weakening, the ratio of the body to the void shifting, and the prayers becoming prayers for the dead. Midday, the church bells finished. Light in excess: still, fog blankets the meadow, so you can’t see the mountain in the distance, covered with snow and ice. When it appears again, my neighbor thinks her prayers are answered. So much light she can’t control her happiness— it has to burst out in language. Hello, she yells, as though that is her best translation. She believes in the Virgin the way I believe in the mountain, though in one case the fog never lifts. But each person stores his hope in a different place. I make my soup, I pour my glass of wine. I’m tense, like a child approaching adolescence. Soon it will be decided for certain what you are, one thing, a boy or girl. Not both any longer. And the child thinks: I want to have a say in what happens. But the child has no say whatsoever. When I was a child, I did not foresee this. Later, the sun sets, the shadows gather, rustling the low bushes like animals just awake for the night. Inside, there’s only firelight. It fades slowly; now only the heaviest wood’s still flickering across the shelves of instruments. I hear music coming from them sometimes, even locked in their cases. When I was a bird, I believed I would be a man. That’s the flute. And the horn answers, When I was a man, I cried out to be a bird. Then the music vanishes. And the secret it confides in me vanishes also. In the window, the moon is hanging over the earth, meaningless but full of messages. It’s dead, it’s always been dead, but it pretends to be something else, burning like a star, and convincingly, so that you feel sometimes it could actually make something grow on earth. If there’s an image of the soul, I think that’s what it is. I move through the dark as though it were natural to me, as though I were already a factor in it. Tranquil and still, the day dawns. On market day, I go to the market with my lettuces"}

As the dry heat, the filled-out leaves thicken the surround, the warming asphalt, &amp; the lull in growth occurs, &amp; in it the single birdcries now and again are placed, &amp; all makes a round from which sound is sturdied-up without dissipation or dilation, bamboo-crisp, &amp; up it goes up like a thing tossed without warp of weight or evidence of overcome gravity, as if space were thinned by summer now to a non-interference.

A call across the tall fence from an invisible neighbor to his child is heard right down to the secret mood in it the child also hears. One hears in the silence that follows the great desire for approval and love which summer holds aloft, all damp leached from it, like a thing floating out on a frail but perfect twig end. Light seeming to darken in it yet glow. Please , it says. But not with the eager need of spring! Come what may, says summer. Smack in the middle I will stand and breathe.

Another man was hoeing up potatoes. What did he represent? It was October. The wild rosebushes were bare. In the fields—brittle Indian corn, pale rows of cabbages. “A landscape now wholly autumnal,” Hawthorne wrote in his journal, and perhaps he noticed the way now means then as soon as it’s written down, the way remembering conceals invention, or tries to. Idea for a tale: a man, composing a story, finds it shaping itself against his intentions. The characters act otherwise than he planned. Unforeseen events occur. Hawthorne paused.

Not to make things was idleness. The house contained things to be made.

I am sitting on a wooden bench, looking out At the lake through a tall screen of evergreens, Or rather, looking out across the plane of the lake, Seeing the light shaking upon the water As if it were a shimmering of heat. Yesterday, when I sat here, it was the same, The same displaced out-of-season effect. Seen twice it seemed a truth was being told. Some of the trees I can see across the lake Have begun to change, but it is as if the air Had entirely given itself over to summer, With the intention of denying its own proper nature. There is a breeze perfectly steady and persistent Blowing in toward shore from the other side Or from the world beyond the other side. The mild sound of the little tapping waves The breeze has caused—there’s something infantile About it, a baby at the breast. The light Is moving and not moving upon the water. The breeze picks up slightly but still steadily, The increase in the breeze becomes the mild Dominant event, compelling with sweet oblivious Authority alterations in light and shadow, Alterations in the light of the sun on the water, Which becomes at once denser and more quietly Excited, like a concentration of emotions That had been dispersed and scattered and now were not. Then there’s the mitigation of the shadow of a cloud, And the light subsides a little, into itself. Although this is a lake it is as if A tide were running mildly into shore. The sound of the water so softly battering Against the shore is decidedly sexual, In its liquidity, its regularity, Its persistence, its infantile obliviousness. It is as if it had come back to being A beginning, an origination of life. The plane of the water is like a page on which Phrases and even sentences are written, But because of the breeze, and the turning of the year, And the sense that this lake water, as it is being Experienced on a particular day, comes from Some source somewhere, beneath, within, itself, Or from somewhere else, nearby, a spring, a brook, Its pure origination somewhere else, It is like an idea for a poem not yet written And maybe never to be completed, because The surface of the page is like lake water, That takes back what is written on its surface, And all my language about the lake and its Emotions or its sweet obliviousness, Or even its being like an origination, Is all erased with the changing of the breeze Or because of the heedless passing of a cloud. When, moments after she died, I looked into Her face, it was as untelling as something natural, A lake, say, the surface of it unreadable, Its sources of meaning unfindable anymore.

But the water’s there, to remind the mothers that they love these children, that for them to drown would be terrible. The mothers are tired constantly, the children are always fighting, the husbands at work or angry. No young man comes.

Ragged, high-strung moths, green lacewings streamlined like F-16s— the geckos, like great officers and kings, took them into their mouths, more or less at leisure, with a gratifying snap.

And always there’s a functionary, somberly listing what he does. The room plays no favorites. Like its windows, it does nothing but accommodate shades of light and dark. After everyone leaves (its entrance, of course, is an exit), the room will need to be imagined by someone, perhaps some me walking away now, who comes alive when most removed.

The end of another day in this floating dream of a life. Renown is a mouthful, here and there. Rivers and mountains glide through my blood. Cold pillow, bittersweet years. In the near distance, a plane’s drone rattles the windows. Clear night. Wind like a predator in the sharp grass of the past. I find it much simpler now to see the other side of my own death. It wasn’t always that way, When the rivers were rivers and mountains were mountains. Now, when the mouth closes, the wind goes out of everything. Fame for a hundred years is merely an afterlife. And no friend of ours. Better to watch the rain fall in the branches of winter trees. Better to have your mail sent To someone else in another town, where frost is whiter than moonlight. Horses, black horses: Midnight, Five Minutes to Midnight. Rider up, the sparks from their hooves like stars, like spiked stars. This is a metaphor for failure, This is the Rest of It, the beautiful horse, black horse. Midnight. Dark horse, dark rider. I love the lethargy of the single cloud, the stillness of the sky On winter afternoons, late on winter afternoons, A little fan of light on the tips of the white pines. I love the winter light, so thin, so unbuttery, Transparent as plastic wrap Clinging so effortlessly to whatever it skins over. —The language of nature, we know, is mathematics. The language of landscape is language, Metaphor, metaphor, metaphor, all down the line. The sweet-breath baby light of a winter afternoon, Boy-light, half covered in blue, almost invisible as breath, So still in the flower beds, so pale. Four days till the full moon, light like a new skin on the dark Quarter, like light unborrowed, hard, black hole with its golden floor. Who knows the happiness of fish, their wind-raising, ordinary subtleties? Describing the indescribable, Image into idea, the transmission of the spirit, It cannot be done. The Chinese principle, breath-resonance-life-motion , Engenders, it was believed. As does the bone method of brushwork, Creating structure in poems as well as pictures. Plotting in paint, place in poetry, Completes composition, the bedrock of spiritual values. Competent, marvellous, and divine Were the three degrees of accomplishment. And still, it cannot be done. Image resists all transmutation. All art is meta-art, and has its own satisfactions. But it’s not divine, as image is, Untouchable, untransmutable, wholly magic.

But my snoring would wake me . . . so I’d look at my wristwatch: and there’d be time left for reading.

Not all, perhaps, but a couple. The fallen leaves litter the lawn and driveway. Autumn. Indian summer. Nothing ripples. The other side of the world, they say, is a door where I’ll find my life again. — New moon like a jai-alai basket just over the doctor’s rooftop, Cradling the old moon before her fall. — If angels can see into the ends and beginnings of things, Why are they still among us Like widowed birds, circling, circling, their poor go-betweens at a full stop? — The cold gowns of the masters, those of a thousand years ago, Over a thousand, and then some, Wander the countryside, brushing like loose crystal against the sumac.

I went back to my room, I did not know how to get out of the world, or how to stay— I sat on the floor with a Sunday Times and read the columns of the first page down, and then the next, and then the next. I can still see how every “a” looked eager—it hadn’t heard, yet, that its boy was gone—and every “f” hung down its head on its broken neck, its little arms held out, as if to say, You see me, this is what I am "}

People confuse their consciences with ghosts and witches. Old men throw everything away because they panic and can’t feel their lives. They pinch themselves, pierce themselves with twigs, cliffs, lightning, and die—yes, finally—in glad pain. You marry a woman you’ve never talked to, a woman you thought was a boy. Sixteen years go by as a curtain billows once, twice. Your children are lost, they come back, you don’t remember how. A love turns to a statue in a dress, the statue comes back to life. Oh God, it’s all so realistic I can’t stand it. Whereat I weep and sing . Such a relief, to burst from the theatre into our cool, imaginary streets where we know who’s who and what’s what, and command with Metrocards our destinations. Where no one with a story struggling in him convulses as it eats its way out, and no one in an antiseptic corridor, or in deserts or in downtown darkling plains, staggers through an Act that just will not end, eyes burning with the burning of the dead.You marry a woman you’ve never talked to, a woman you thought was a boy.

Neither had anything in mind, so they conversed about the upcoming baseball season about which neither cared. We could be a couple, he thought, but she was all wrong, way too skinny. For years he’d had an image of the way a woman should look, and it wasn’t her, it wasn’t anyone he’d ever known, certainly not his ex-wife, who’d moved back south to live with her high-school sweetheart. About killed him. I don’t need that shit, he almost said aloud, and then realized she’d been talking to someone, maybe to him, about how she couldn’t get her hands right, how the grease ate so deeply into her skin it became a part of her, and she put her hand, palm up, on the bar and pointed with her cigarette at the deep lines the work had carved. “The life line,” he said, “which one is that?” “None,” she said, and he noticed that her eyes were hazel flecked with tiny spots of gold, and then—embarrassed—looked back at her hand, which seemed tiny and delicate, the fingers yellowed with calluses but slender and fine. She took a paper napkin off the bar, spit on it and told him to hold still while she carefully lifted his glasses up on his forehead, leaving him half blind, and wiped something off above his left cheekbone. “There,” she said, lowering his glasses, “I got it,” and even with his glasses on what she showed him was nothing he could see. He thought, better get out of here before it’s too late, but knew too late was what he wanted"}
